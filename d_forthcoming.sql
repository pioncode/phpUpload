'Insensible worlds: postrelational ethics, indeterminacy and the (k)nots of relating',
'Within the context of biodiversity loss, this paper asks the question: What is
response? In asking how responsibility is raised as a sensible question, I argue there
is a need to address the insensible, immaterial, and untimely dimensions of matter and
relations. I suggest that thinking along the cusp of the insensible offers a way into an
expanded realm of relationality that queries the exclusions that govern the sphere of
intelligibility, and help us think between natures to promote a noncontemporaneous ethics
of apprehension. Taking up Jean-Luc Nancy\'s concept of sense and specifically his ideas
around the direction of sense, I argue that the insensible is a realm of possibility within
the praxis of social and affective norms of sense that may release other modes of being
into being. This is a paper about sense as matter forming, as cohabitation, and as an
exclusionary tactic that bears on the cohabitation of worlds. I argue that an understanding
of how sense is enrolled into our habits of thought and theories of materialities is crucial
if we are to create new practices of sensations and new sensibilities around such diffuse,
recalcitrant, and dislocated issues as biodiversity loss, new forms of biotechnological life,
and climate change. I conclude that if the insensible alerts us to the work of sense in
securing the bringing into relation, its configurations, and its a priori orientations, then
it also points towards modes of exclusion and forms of resistance in our thinking with
nonhuman others that are before and beyond relationality.<br>
