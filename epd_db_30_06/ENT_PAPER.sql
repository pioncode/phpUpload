'<i>Geo</i>power: a panel on Elizabeth Grosz’s <i>Chaos,
Territory, Art: Deleuze and the Framing of the Earth</i>',
'Rather than understand art as cultural accomplishment, Elizabeth Grosz argues
that it is born from the intensities of chaos and disruptive forms of sexual selection&mdash;a
corporeality that vibrates to the hum of the universe. Grosz contends that it is precisely
this excessive, nonproductive expenditure of sexual attraction that is the condition for
art’s work. This intimate corporeality, composed of nonhuman forces, is what draws
and transforms the cosmos, prompting experimentation with materiality, sensation, and
life. In the book <i>Chaos, Territory, Art: Deleuze and the Framing of the Earth</i> (2008, Duke
University Press, Durham, NC), that is the subject of this panel discussion, Grosz sets
out an ontology of art, looking at its forms of emergence as territorialising force, sexual
selection, and nonhuman power. In Grosz’s terms, art is an art of existence. This is not
a narrow understanding of art as a practice that is about taste, cultural accomplishment,
or a reflection of society, but an art that is&mdash;at its most provocative&mdash;an extraction from
the universe and an elaboration on it. This ‘geoaesthetics’ which is both biospheric and
biopolitical, presents a formable challenge to geographers interested in art, sexuality, time,
and the territorialisation of the earth. How might we understand this distinctly different
kind of biopolitics? And what might Grosz’s concept of ‘geopower’ offer in terms of a
renegotiation of a more active ‘geo’ in geopolitics? Grosz argues that art is not tied to the
reproduction of the known, but to the possibility of the new, overcoming the containment
of the present to elaborate on futures yet to come. In this rethinking of sexual selection
Grosz suggests an intensely political role for art as a bioaesthetics that is charged with the
creation of new worlds and forms of life. Grosz makes a radical argument for a feminist
philosophy of the biosphere and for our thinking the world otherwise.'

'&#8216;Small-town defenders&#8217;: the production of citizenship and belonging in Hazleton, Pennsylvania',
'Over the past five years an aggressive movement has emerged to return immigration enforcement powers to the local level in the US, and to some extent in Europe as well. Hazleton, PA, was home to the first local government in the US to pass an &#8216;Illegal Immigration Relief Act&#8217; (IIRA), which subsequently became a model for other cities across the country seeking to implement their own immigration regulations. We argue that Hazleton&#8217;s IIRA was as much productive of tensions over migration as it was the product of them. Neoliberal economic restructuring left Hazleton residents feeling a sense of &#8216;class downgrading&#8217; but the ordinance itself was central in creating divisions between the native-born white population and recent Latino arrivals. As much as the ordinance served to exclude undocumented immigrants, it simultaneously served to unify native-born white residents by repositioning Hazleton as &#8216;small-town USA&#8217;, no longer marginal but, instead, central to the defense of American &#8216;quality of life&#8217;. Control over housing became a key form of spatial and territorial control through the creation of a location in which outsiders could be defined as not-belonging and local citizenship could be imbued with&#160;new meaning. The paper illuminates the ways in which &#8216;Americanness&#8217; and citizenship are locally constructed and highlights the significance of territorial control and collective identity in addition to economic restructuring in the resurgence of local immigration regulations.

'Illuminated atmospheres: anticipating and reproducing the flow of affective experience in Blackpool',
'This paper considers the atmospheric qualities of illuminated space, grounding notions of affect in investigating the longstanding autumnal event of Blackpool Illuminations. I consider the affective qualities of lighting before discussing the &#8216;atmosphere&#8217; of the Illuminations. I critically explore the division between affect and emotion, the insistence on affect&#8217;s precognitive qualities, and the notion that affective atmospheres produce a &#8216;mute attunement&#8217; to place. In foregrounding the dense social production of atmosphere at Blackpool Illuminations, I highlight the flow of affect and emotion in place, show how lighting is ideally constituted to blur divisions between the representational and nonrepresentational, identify the anticipation of affect, and demonstrate that affective atmospheres are coproduced by visitors as part of a reiterative, festive, convivial, and playful social practice in familiar space.

'Graduated and paternal sovereignty: Stephen Harper, Operation Nanook 10, and the Canadian Arctic',
'The idea of &#8216;graduated sovereignty&#8217; has been used in economic geography and related fields to describe neoliberal capitalism and its negative implications for countries in the Global South. Scholars such as Aihwa Ong use the term primarily to reflect on how states and their elites in the Global South flexibly manage territories and populations at different spatial scales, including export-processing zones. In this paper, attention is given to how &#8216;graduated sovereignty&#8217; is a useful lens to interrogate territorial claims (including the preservation of territorial integrity) and the spatially varied performance of state power. The Canadian government led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his government&#8217;s Arctic policies and strategies are a case in point. Graduated sovereignty is only one element, however, as the paper considers how a form of paternal sovereignty plays a part in managing the normative ideas of territorial integrity, the presence of exceptional circumstances, and the role of future uncertainties. Using Operation Nanook 10 as a short case study, the paper considers how the government puts to work an uncertain future regarding the Canadian Arctic is materialised and then made actionable by invoking both graduated and paternal forms of sovereignty.

'Reassembling the event: Estonia&#8217;s &#8216;Bronze Night&#8217;',
'At the end of April 2007, an event unfolded in Tallinn, Estonia, that came to be called the &#8216;Bronze Night&#8217;. Most of the research on this event&#8212;and on events in general&#8212;uses an after-the-act representational approach that treats events as effects whose cause lies elsewhere, external to the event in its becoming. Partially because of this, most research into events emphasizes temporal path-dependency and all but ignores the spatiality of events. Following Deleuze&#8217;s philosophy of the event, I seek to learn from the Bronze Night as an event by using an in-the-act procedure of reassemblage. In reassembling the event, I pay special attention to its spatiality: to processes of deterritorialization and reterritorialization, to event-spaces produced and partially captured, and to the event&#8217;s transitivity to new spaces. The paper ends with a discussion of the ways in which the conditions of the problem that actualized the event were newly determined in and through the event, creating opportunities for the event&#8217;s counteractualization.

'Binning, gifting and recovery: the conduits of disposal in&#160;household food consumption',
'This paper explores the movements and placings that work to configure food as waste. At issue here&#8212;following the work of Nicky Gregson, Kevin Hetherington, and Rolland Munro&#8212;are the multiple conduits that exist for &#8216;moving things along&#8217; and the idea that consumption research needs to move beyond the unfortunate conjunction of disposal and waste. I suggest that the disposal of surplus food is enacted via a graduated process in which it first enters a &#8216;gap&#8217; where ambiguities and anxieties surrounding its residual value and onward trajectory are addressed. Drawing on ethnographic examples, I explore the shifting contours and gradients that reduce the possibilities for disposing of food through conduits in which it can be handed down, handed around, or otherwise saved from wastage. I&#160;also unpack the overwhelming tendency for surplus food to be cast as &#8216;excess&#8217; and placed in conduits&#8212;typically the bin&#8212;that connect it to the waste stream. Crucially, it is suggested that food is a specific genre of material culture and that this underpins the normativity of its binning alongside the attendant prevention of its recirculation or recovery. To conclude, I reflect on the broader implications of this analysis for understandings of consumption, disposal, and waste.

'Racial violence and the cosmopolitan city',
'In this paper I argue that cosmopolitanisms, as visions of living with difference, and race and racisms, as political regimes of subjection and subjectification, are mutually constitutive. Although scholars have made similar claims regarding earlier versions of cosmopolitanisms, developed largely from the work of Immanuel Kant, recent proponents have conceptualized their renewed formulations, detached from Eurocentric histories and newly expanded to include the migrant, refugee, and subaltern, as promissory visions of conviviality and often as an antidote to racisms. Despite efforts to expand cosmopolitanisms to include racial subjects previously excluded, these visions may be productive of new, renewed, and changing forms of racial subjection. Specifically, I argue that racisms are an immanent and organizing logic manifest in the production of racial heterogeneities and differentiations upon which cosmopolitical visions depend and also generative of the cosmopolitan outlook these encounters are thought to require. To situate and develop these claims, I open with a 1907 sketch published in the Illustrated London News which depicts Vancouver, Canada both as &#8220;the most cosmopolitan city in the world&#8221; (Begg, 1907, page&#160;476) and as a site of anti-Asian violence. Approaching this image both as a historical example and as an opening for critical inquiry, I untangle the constitutive relations between racisms and cosmopolitanisms through the labor demands of global capitalism and in the cultivated indifference that is frequently identified as the hallmark of a cosmopolitan disposition. While the conjoined forces of colonialism and capitalism effectuated the historico-material basis of ethnoracial difference, what some have termed an &#8216;ordinary cosmopolitanism&#8217;, these conditions did not lead to conviviality alone. Rather, in racially charged colonial Vancouver, the indifference that Europeans putatively expressed in their encounters with migrants from China, Japan, and later India, commonly erupted into racial enmity and violence. What might this historical example afford to contemporary discussions regarding the present and future of the new cosmopolitanisms?

'Subjectivity, modernity, and the politics of difference in a periurban village in China: towards a progressive sense of place?',
'In this paper we investigate the cultural imageries of place and their relation to the politics of difference within China&#8217;s emerging space of modernity. Using a case study of the place politics in Xiaozhou Village, Guangzhou, we consider how particular subject positions in relation to the ideologies of modernity and rurality shape particular imaginative structures of place and cognitive mappings of social relations. We argue that Massey&#8217;s theory of a global sense of place needs to include a dimension concerning how concrete subject positions can be negotiated and challenged in the imagination of place. We also contend for a face-to-face politics of difference to analyze the anxieties and tensions between particularized subject positions. In concluding this paper we also suggest that the political potential of this model of place politics lies in its recognition that, while conflicts which are grounded in place-based social relations will not vanish, place should not to be mobilized as a citadel within which an enclosed subjectivity is protected from the interference of otherness. Thus the Other is also ascribed with the political potential to reproduce the cognitive mapping of the lifeworld of <i>mine</i>.

'On arrival: memory and temporality at Ellis Island, New&#160;York',
'Museums and heritage operations are increasingly employing experiential forms of interpretation, such as role adoption and first-person interpretation, in order to cultivate emotional bonds between visitors and the characters that populate historic sites. The paper argues that this form of relating to the past affectively reflects a notion of memory that is underpinned by commonsense temporality and a privileging of the corporeal, both of which serve to legitimate existing relations of power. Using a&#160;dispute surrounding public entry to Ellis Island, New York, via a bridge connected to New Jersey, I&#160;ask that we understand memory as a practice generating the past&#8217;s perpetual arrival where the past continually comes into existence anew rather than &#8216;returns&#8217; from what once was. Throughout the paper I relate a number of examples where thinking about memory along these lines, as arrival, can help us question the temporal logics that underpin heritage and the authorities heritage maintains.
