'Creating ‘a generation of NIMBYs’? Interpreting the
role of the state in managing the politics of urban
development',
'<b>Abstract.</b>The traditional relationship between politics and policy making has been
challenged in recent years, highlighting how policy itself can generate political action.
This raises questions about how conflict produced or mediated through the policy process
is managed, particularly within what has been described as a ‘postpolitical settlement’
where fundamental politicoideological issues are liable to be ‘displaced’ rather than
opened up for debate. I argue that such displacement generates its own distinctive
politicomanagerial logic. Drawing on the discourses and practices of planning reform in
England, I suggest that ongoing systemic reform might be understood as a product of a
politics of displacement that seeks to cover over the causes of the antagonism generated
by the logic of urban development. Tracing this logic through the policy process, I further
suggest that displacement has a range of underexamined effects on local democracy and
the legitimacy of local government.

'Who benefits and who loses from flood risk reduction?',
'<b>Abstract.</b>The distributional effects of investment for the reduction of flood risk are
explored, with the UK as an example. Using three case studies, we initially investigate
the ‘gainers’ and the ‘losers’ from three contrasting engineering-oriented flood alleviation
and land drainage schemes, the results of which appear to show that property owners
at risk of flooding were the gainers and the general flood-free taxpayer was the loser.
An analysis of flood damages, however, shows that those losing work from repairing or
replacing flood damaged goods are a primary loser group as risk is reduced. Investigating
insurance cover for flooding (near-universal in the UK) also shows that the principal
real gainers appear to be insurance companies and their shareholders, since premiums
generally do not appear to fall as risk is reduced. The implication of these novel results are
evaluated both for the UK and, briefly, for elsewhere in the world.

'Growing grassroots innovations: exploring the role of
community-based initiatives in governing sustainable
energy transitions',
'<b>Abstract.</b>The challenges of sustainable development (and climate change and peak oil, in
particular) demand system-wide transformations in sociotechnical systems of provision.
An academic literature around coevolutionary innovation for sustainability has recently
emerged as an attempt to understand the dynamics and directions of such sociotechnical
transformations, which are termed ‘sustainability transitions’. This literature has previously
focused on market-based technological innovations. Here we apply it to a new context of
civil-society-based social innovation and examine the role of community-based initiatives
in a transition to a low-carbon sustainable economy in the UK. We present new empirical
research from a study of the UK’s Transition Towns movement (a ‘grassroots innovation’)
and assess its attempts to grow and influence wider societal sociotechnical systems. By
applying strategic niche management theory to this civil society context, we deliver
theoretically informed practical recommendations for this movement to diffuse beyond its
niche: to foster deeper engagement with resourceful regime actors; to manage expectations
more realistically by delivering tangible opportunities for action and participation; and
to embrace a community-based, action-oriented model of social change (in preference to
a cognitive theory of behaviour change). Furthermore, our study indicates areas where
theory can be refined to better explain the growth and broader impacts of grassroots
innovations —namely, through a fuller appreciation of the importance of internal niche
processes, by understanding the important role of identity and group formation, and by
resolving how social practices change in grassroots innovations.

'A boundary organization and its changing environment: the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, the MNP',
'<b>Abstract.</b> In this paper we address the way boundary organizations can accommodate tensions in the science &#8211; politics interface. Literature on boundary organizations suggests that this type of organization can provide stability in science &#8211; politics interaction, but how these organizations function over a longer period of time is not a point of theoretical or empirical attention. We study a boundary organization, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (MNP), by analyzing the ideas that guided the foundation of the MNP and by analyzing two cases in which the MNP advised Dutch policy makers. In both cases the MNP had to adjust its boundary orientation because of changes in its institutional context. These findings show that the dynamics involved in boundary organizations should be included in academic research. We conclude by discussing two conceptual frameworks that may help to capture these dynamics: the notion of &#8216;learning organizations&#8217; and a typology of roles of experts in politics.

'Achievements and opportunities in initiating governance for urban sustainability',
'<b>Abstract.</b> The concept of urban sustainability governance has developed as an institutional guiding concept to holistically address the vitality of cities under a long-term perspective and is based on the collaborative efforts of government, administration, business, science,&#160;and the civil society. Yet, the initiation and implementation of this guiding concept faces a variety of barriers, including deficient conceptualization, unfamiliarity, detrimental organizational structures, and inertia. We examine the initiation of urban sustainability governance in the City of Richmond, British Columbia, Canada. On the basis of the reviews of administrative documents and interviews with staff across various administrative levels and units, we reflect on achievements and shortcomings against guidelines of urban sustainability governance spelled out in the literature. Our study indicates accomplishments in the conceptualization of a vision and overall framework to operate from, but also a number of deficits in specifying sustainability targets, applying governance principles, and evaluating impacts. Additionally, we discuss how administrative structures influence how urban sustainability governance is being implemented. We draw conclusions regarding general factors for succeeding in the initiation and implementation of urban sustainability governance.

'Proceeding in parallel or drifting apart? A systematic review of policy appraisal research and practices',
'<b>Abstract.</b> Policy appraisal has spread rapidly throughout the OECD and beyond, as has the associated academic literature. In this paper we present the findings of a systematic review of this literature. We assess the extent to which developments in academic research and in everyday appraisal practices have informed one other. While there are signs that policy appraisal research is moving away from the &#8216;technical &#8211; rational model&#8217; of appraisal, both research and practice remain heavily informed by it. The review reveals that research and practice are interacting in subtle ways, but these fall well short of what is sought by advocates of more reflexive approaches. We systematically examine the exact pattern of research &#8211; practice interaction depicted in the literature and explore how this may change in the future.

'Policy conflict and the feasibility of water pollution trading programs in the Tai Lake Basin, China',
'<b>Abstract.</b> Water pollution trading (WPT) is considered a cost-effective policy instrument for controlling water pollution. Since the late 1990s the Chinese government has piloted WPT programs at different levels in an attempt to reduce water pollution. However, the implementation of WPT programs has not achieved the results expected. Policy overlap, or conflict, is thought to be one of main factors blocking the deployment of effective WPT projects in China. This research takes the WPT pilot program in the Tai Lake Basin as a case study to assess the problem of incoherent policies in this area and to explore the general feasibility of WPT programs in China. We review and analyze the water pollution control system in the Tai Lake Basin as well as the regulation and practices of the WPT Tai Lake pilot program. The results of this study indicate that the WPT program in the&#160;Tai&#160;Lake Basin conflicts fundamentally with other environmental regulation regimes, such as the Environmental Impact Assessment system and the Five-Year Plan target, and that the prospects for WPT in China are not optimistic. Finally, we outline suggestions for reforming China&#8217;s WPT mechanism to eliminate these conflicts.

'Is regional planning dead or just coping? The&#160;transformation of a state sociospatial project into&#160;growth-oriented strategies',
'<b>Abstract.</b> How is regional planning transformed in increasingly changing socioeconomic and political contexts? How are regional planning policies and practices ultimately shaped&#160;and why? With this paper, the author proposes and applies an analytical model based on notions of state theory, state spatial selectivity, new planning spaces, and policy discourses to examine how regional planning has evolved in the course of the past four or so decades. On the basis of an analysis concerned with the history and evolution of Danish regional planning, he argues that regional planning has shifted away from being a sociospatial and welfarist state project towards being a domain characterised by growth-oriented strategies that stand for neoliberal political agendas. In examining this process the author suggests that hierarchical forms of governance and the statutory mechanisms embedded within them have been largely&#160;substituted by emerging soft spaces of governance and flexible policies intended to&#160;destabilise formal planning arenas. Finally, he discusses the fact that the &#8216;classical&#8211;modernist&#8217; steering role of regional planning that once sought to tackle socioeconomic disparities has been replaced by a facilitating role that promotes competitiveness through growth-oriented policy instruments.

'Ethnic minority business support in the West Midlands: challenges and developments',
'<b>Abstract.</b> We examine the challenges and developments relating to the support of ethnic minority businesses (EMBs). The challenges pertain to the distinctiveness of business support needs, the &#8216;mainstreaming&#8217; of EMB support, and the dynamics of delivery. An &#8216;engaged scholarship&#8217; approach is adopted, on the basis of an examination of business support providers in the West Midlands. We find considerable evidence of &#8216;policy learning&#8217; in respect of these challenges. Hence, a nuanced approach to EMB support needs is in evidence, and &#8216;good practice&#8217; principles are adhered to in respect of mainstreaming and EMB engagement. However, the new era of austerity imperils many of these gains.

'(Un)sustainable territories: causes of the speculative bubble in Spain (1996&#8211;2010) and its territorial, environmental, and sociopolitical consequences',
'<b>Abstract.</b> In this paper we analyse the causes of the Spanish property model and its territorial, social, and political consequences. Particular attention is paid to sociopolitical contexts. These consequences include excessive dependence on economic activity and employment in the housing construction sector, the irreversible disappearance of landmarks in the country&#8217;s collective history and culture, and examples of &#8216;policy capture&#8217;, especially at local and regional levels. This lengthy process has led to corruption in town planning and an increase in poor policy decisions, greatly harming Spain&#8217;s reputation.
