'Media, religion and the marketplace in the information economy: evidence from Singapore',
'In this paper we suggest that the exchange of communication in a mediatized environment is transforming the nature of transactions in the religious marketplace. In&#160;this economy of religious informational exchanges, digitalization facilitates a process of mediatization that converts religious performance into forms suitable for commodification and commoditization. The intersection of digital media, religion, and the marketplace is demonstrated in the context of mega Protestant and Buddhist organizations in Singapore. We show how these large organizations embed media relations in their sacred spaces through a process of hybridization. In turn, hybrid spaces are converted into material outputs that may be readily transacted in real and virtual spaces. Hybridization attends to a postmodern audience and consumers who value experience and sensorial stimulations. It integrates retail, entertainment, and the aesthetics into a space of ascetic performance that is digitally transportable. Digital transactional spaces thrive on the abundance of information, and information multiplies when communication is unfettered by the absence of proprietary safeguards. The religious marketplace may therefore be understood as a medially driven performance space where points of interaction are digitally convertible for further reproduction, reconsumption, and redistribution in media form.

'Consumer satisfaction with local retail diversity in the UK: effects of supermarket access, brand variety, and social deprivation',
'Levels of concentration in the grocery sector have led to concerns about reduced diversity of local retail provision and its potential negative effects on consumer welfare and choice. Using empirical evidence from a study of consumer perceptions of retail choice across nine purposefully sampled neighbourhoods in the city of Worcester in the UK, the paper illuminates consumer satisfaction with local provision and investigates how satisfaction varies with the local mix of grocery stores. The study adopts a stated-preference approach with realistic but hypothetical scenarios being presented to consumers in which the level, form, brand composition, and accessibility of local retail provision is systematically varied to gauge the sensitivity of householders in different types of neighbourhoods to variations in local retail assortments. The contributions of the paper are reflected in three main findings: (1) residents value having a large supermarket close by and reveal that they value diversity of provision rather than overconcentration; (2) consumers in deprived areas overall display greater satisfaction for the same offer than&#160;consumers in less deprived&#160;areas; and (3) although small stores in a local store assortment significantly contribute to reducing dissatisfaction with the local retail offer, they contribute little to achieving higher levels of consumer satisfaction. The study stresses the need for planners and policy makers to maximise choice and welfare through both the number and the diversity of stores in local neighbourhood areas.

'Land-conservation strategies: the dynamic relationship between acquisition and land-use planning',
'Nonprofit organizations often pursue land acquisition as a nonpolitical, private property rights approach to conservation of ecological and cultural resources. Yet acquisition and regulatory land-use planning are intertwined, both in terms of political strategies and conservation outcomes. Our objectives are (1)&#160;to understand the relationship between the acquisition strategies of land trusts and their involvement in land-use planning and zoning, and (2)&#160;to examine how the interactions between acquisition and land-use planning may shape conservation outcomes. We focus on the strategies of The Nature Conservancy, one of the largest conservation NGOs in the United States. Drawing from an institutional analysis framework, we compare case studies from Tehama and Monterey Counties, California. Through semistructured interviews, analysis of land-use plans and conservation-easement agreements, and GIS mapping we examine political strategies and conservation outcomes. Our analysis reveals that acquisition strategies and the regulatory context influence each other strongly, but that tensions between the politics of these strategies challenge conservation actors to deploy both effectively. Finally, we develop themes for future research, suggesting that the implementation and assessment of regional conservation efforts would benefit from an integrated strategy that recognizes the synergistic linkages between acquisition and regulatory land-use planning.

'Do incomers pay more for rural housing?',
'The paper explores whether incomers pay a price premium for rural housing and, if so, whether it varies according to the origin of the buyer. Empirical analysis focuses on Aberdeenshire, Scotland, distinguishing between housing in the accessible and remote rural locations within the region. Buyers originating from Aberdeen city are found to pay more than locals in accessible rural housing markets, with the price premium highest in the high-quality housing-market segment. There is, however, no evidence that a price premium is paid by in-migrants from more distant locations. In contrast, consistent with information asymmetry and higher search costs, buyers from the rest of the UK are found to pay significantly more for high-quality properties in the remote rural area. From a methodological perspective the findings support the use of multilevel models which allow for unobserved neighbourhood effects.

'We&#8217;re number two! Beta cities and the cultural economy',
'Given that not every city can be an alpha city in today&#8217;s global urban hierarchy, what options do beta cities such as Toronto or Chicago realistically have in the cultural economy? Put differently, if cultural capitals such as New York, London, Paris, and Tokyo play critically important roles in certifying and establishing new trends in theatre, fashion, and other cultural industries, how can beta cities compete? Recent research suggests that the spatial distribution of cultural industries strongly resembles one of urban hierarchy, where the institutions and infrastructure that support the production and diffusion of new products are largely concentrated in only a few world cities. The implication of this hierarchy is that there is a clearly defined top tier that lower ranked, beta, cities look to for inspiration as they seek to improve their standing. Comparative case studies of musical theatre scenes in Toronto and New York provide insights into an alternative functional perspective on urban hierarchies and the complementarities among cities. This approach makes a distinction between development and diffusion activities, thereby recognizing opportunities for beta cities as important sites for experimentation and innovation, supported by attributes that could be seen as unique (and localized) strengths in an increasingly global cultural economy.

'The influence of school choice policy on active school commuting: a case study of a middle-sized school district in Oregon',
'School choice policy has implications for school travel as it allows students to attend schools farther from their residence than their neighborhood schools. This paper uses a case study from Oregon to investigate how school choice affects parents&#8217; school travel decision making and the degree to which school choice affects children&#8217;s walking or biking to school. The research shows that school choice is associated with lengthened school travel distance and parents&#8217; greater willingness to drive their children to school even within a short distance. The research suggests that school choice could hinder the effectiveness of such programs as Safe Routes to School.

'Justifying business responses to climate change: discursive strategies of similarity and difference',
'Despite increasing interest in corporate environmentalism, less attention has been directed to how corporations justify and defend their initiatives in this area. This is important in understanding how corporate environmentalism is legitimized in the face of crises, such as climate change, and the ongoing criticism of corporations&#8217; deleterious impacts upon the environment. Based on qualitative data from Australian corporations, we illustrate how organizations and managers employ a range of justifications for their activities in order to meet criticism and challenges. We identify different discursive legitimation strategies that are used by managers to deal with conflicts between justifications, and argue that this framework has broader implications in understanding the arguments that underpin social conflict over environmental sustainability.

'Projected futures: the political matter of UK higher activity radioactive waste',
'This paper identifies, and works from, the technoconceptual as a site of intervention for a politics of stuff. Its case is radioactive waste: specifically, UK higher activity wastes (HAW) and the policy future of a UK Deep Geological Disposal Facility (DGF). The paper proceeds through three steps. It charts, first, the unravelling of HAW as onto-politics through the democratisation of technoscience, showing that, as the gap between stuff and politics has opened, HAW&#8217;s future in a DGF has become the preserve of science&#8211;technical discourses (currently geology and engineered design). Secondly, it joins with the undone-science traditions of STS (science, technology, and society), to critique existing technoscientific conceptualisations of a DGF and to anticipate a future in which a DGF is abandoned. Third, and in response to abandonment, it proposes a different future for a DGF. This starts from thinking radioactive waste as &#8216;thing power&#8217; but argues that,&#160;for a DGF to be materialised in ways that forge attachments with publics, requires a turn to material culture. More broadly, the paper argues that furthering onto-politics requires keeping the demos alive to stuff&#8217;s vitality. This means engaging in political settlements of technoscientific controversies; with old, or established, technologies, and &#8216;cold&#8217; politics; and in politics as practised.

'Participatory approaches to land policy reform in Zambia: potentials and challenges',
'The subject of participation is now at the core of many contemporary development debates. This is promoted within the emerging context of moving away from &#8216;government&#8217; to &#8216;governance&#8217; as stakeholders are increasingly getting frustrated by governments&#8217; continued application of the mundane Decide, Announce, and Defend (DAD) approaches to policy making. However, despite the voluminous amount of literature on participation, there is little scholarly work on whether or how communities, particularly those in rural and periurban locations, participate in land policy processes. This paper examines the extent to which Zambia&#8217;s land policy process is participatory on the part of rural/periurban communities. The paper argues that despite its potential, genuine participation of rural communities in land policy processes in Zambia is constrained by cultural/social norms that defer the views of rural communities to those of their traditional rulers. On the other hand, periurban communities are excluded from the participatory agenda by the dynamics surrounding struggles over land and proceeds accruing from land transactions. The implication of these findings is that, since participatory requirements/expectations of rural communities may not necessarily be similar to those of periurban communities, there is need to explore the potential of designing &#8216;bespoke&#8217; policies that would accommodate the needs of the individual communities.

'Contrapuntal urbanisms: towards a postcolonial relational geography',
'Relational geography has reformulated how we study cities, but has reiterated perennial problems in the discipline between the utility of theory and the complex realities it purports to represent. I argue that by constructing this problem as a dialogue between urban and postcolonial studies, we can find better ways to understand this frustration and reflexively engage with it. Through reworking Edward Said&#8217;s &#8216;contrapuntal&#8217; perspective, I propose a relational urban geography which is more sensitive to the ontological limitations of theory, and which takes a provisional approach to conceptualising and writing about cities. I then illustrate these propositions through a contrapuntal reading of recent redevelopment in Cork, Ireland.

'Who makes the (new) metropolis? Cross-border coalition and urban development in Paris',
'In fragmented agglomerations, urban development in peripheral areas tends to express the hegemony of the core city over its suburbs. However, this paper demonstrates that, despite deep-rooted political conflicts, intermunicipal cooperation can still take place in the context of cross-border development. I argue that cross-border development has a political and economic logic that is driven by a different power configuration in the metropolis: cross-border coalitions. These coalitions emerge when the redevelopment of areas around municipal borders provides an opportunity for political interests to strengthen their electoral alliances and for business interests to exploit possibilities of growth. This paper investigates urban development in Paris North East, an area on the periphery of Paris that crosses municipal boundaries. It examines how a coalition of public and private actors is cooperating based on the shared benefits they can derive from developments in this area. The case study captures the complex political and economic dynamics driving intermunicipal cooperation by examining the role of local political coalitions, their link with planning agencies, and the behavior of emergent metropolitan entrepreneurs.

'Tolerance to commuting in urban household location choice: evidence from the Paris metropolitan area',
'Many social scientists consider improvements in urban travel facilities during the last decades of the 20th century to have significantly weakened proximity constraints, and therefore think that home&#8211;workplace proximity is no longer a major factor in household location choice. They believe that better transport conditions give households more freedom in selecting their homes and workplaces, regardless of the distance separating these two locations. It is argued that this point of view underestimates the costs of daily commuting (which remain an increasing function of trip length), and consequently overestimates households&#8217; tolerance to commuting. The author&#8217;s aim is to measure how much weight households give to home&#8211;workplace proximity in actual location choices. With the aid of survey data from the Paris-&#206;le-de-France metropolitan area, two values are estimated: (i) the share of home and workplace changes (observed between 1991 and 2002) which either bring home and workplace closer to each other or keep these two places close to each other, and (ii) the <i>&#8216;</i>life expectancy&#8217; of job&#8211;residence combinations which impose long-distance commutes.

'Population mobility in regeneration areas: trends, drivers, and implications; evidence from England&#8217;s New Deal for Communities Programme',
'The nature, extent, and impact of residential mobility have attracted considerable interest. Little of this work has explored relationships between mobility and outcomes for area-based regeneration schemes. England&#8217;s New Deal for Communities (NDC) Programme marks a departure from previous regeneration programmes in terms of levels of funding and time span. Evidence suggests that between 2002 and 2006 the thirty-nine NDC areas were subject to complex patterns of mobility, the most important drivers of which were age and tenure. Residents moving out of NDC areas did so for housing and environmental reasons and were less disadvantaged than those who stayed. Those moving into the areas during this period were not more disadvantaged than existing residents. Although there are associations between mobility and outcome change, these are not as strong as might be anticipated and their implications for area-based regeneration policy appear relatively marginal.
