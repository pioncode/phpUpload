        <span class="bold">Abstract.</span> The recent interest in the role of transport in social interactions has been partly motivated by the hope of achieving a better understanding of the role that transport plays in network capital, or the resources that people can gather from their social networks. Despite the relevancy of this question for policy, little empirical work has been done to elucidate this relationship. This paper illustrates a method of data collection and analysis, using the social networks approach to assess the role of transport in social support, both emotional and material. The personal networks of two neighbourhoods in Concepción, Chile, with different income levels, are compared, focusing on the role of car ownership in network capital, and the relevance of the time and space characteristics of social contacts. The results suggest that having a car at home does not lead to homogeneous access to network capital, which depends heavily on the kind of social resource studied and the income context (neighbourhood) in which the individuals are embedded. The findings also underscore the need to treat social capital as a truly multidimensional concept and the usefulness of the personal networks approach for assessing these complex relationships.

        In recent years, travel behaviour researchers have broadened their perspectives beyond microeconomic paradigms, expanding their theories and models through activity-based paradigms (Chapin, 1974), recognizing that travel is generally derived from the need to perform activities. This approach has allowed substantial advances in data collection, analysis, and the modelling of urban travel behaviour (Buliung and Kanaroglou, 2007).

        <span xml:lang="en-CA">This paper focuses on the intertwined relationships between social relations (networks) and social support (capital), considering their temporal, spatial, and travel context. The paper addresses the question of the relevance of car ownership on the spatial and temporal patterns of networks, and their relationship with people’s access to social support resources. To answer this question, a method of data collection and analysis based on the social networks approach is used as a tool for assessing the relevance of transport (cars) in social capital. The empirical setting is Concepción, Chile, a city where a minority of the population owns a car, and most people rely on public transport and nonmotorised modes to perform their daily activities.

        Research about the role of transport and social capital is challenged by the heterogeneous definition of social capital (eg, Portes, 1998). Bearing these issues in mind, this section first briefly reviews the concepts of social networks and network capital, and then discusses recent elaborations regarding the relationship between social networks and transport.

        <span xml:lang="en-CA">The concept of social capital has gained increasing importance given its potential policy implications in a variety of contexts: ‘positive’ communities provide the benefit of social capital to their members. However, the definition and scope of social capital varies substantially among authors; extensive reviews and discussions of the concept are available</span> <span xml:lang="en-CA">in the literature (Fischer, 2005; Lin, 1999; 2008; Portes, 1998; Putnam, 2000). This paper builds on Bourdieu’s definition of social capital as “potential resources which are linked to the possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance or recognition”</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">(1986, page&#160;248)</span><span xml:lang="en-CA">, constituting one of the forms of capital whose distribution contributes to the reproduction of social structure. As expressed by Lin, these are “resources embedded in one’s social networks, resources that can be accessed or mobilized through ties in networks” (2008, page</span><span xml:lang="en-CA">&#160;71), which can be seen as an individualistic approach to social capital. These definitions are preferred over community and institutional based definitions, due to their consistency with the personal social network perspective, as will be explained.</span>

        <span xml:lang="en-CA">The social network perspective adopted in this paper is more than metaphorical, drawing on four decades of findings in sociology and other disciplines</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">(Wellman and Berkowitz, 1988)</span><span xml:lang="en-CA">.

        <li class="body-quotes" xml:lang="en-GB">[social network analysis] conceives social structure as a social network, that is a set of actors (nodes) and a set of relationships connecting pairs of these actors; the actors can be groups, organizations or even nation-states as well as persons, and the relationships are flows of resources that reflect relations of control, dependence, and cooperation. Network analysis’ core concern is to understand how social structures facilitate and constrain opportunities, behaviours, and cognitions. Network analysts investigate patterns of relationships that connect members of social systems, and how these patterns channel resources to specific locations in social structures” (pages&#160;266–267).

As Wellman and Frank (2001) state, “the loosely-coupled, networked nature of contemporary societies means that social capital comes contingently from a variety of persons, ties and networks, rather than stably from a single, soldiery group” (page&#160;234), not only emphasizing the importance of strong, dense, reciprocal, and formal normative ties in social capital—as Coleman</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">(1988)</span> <span xml:lang="en-CA">does—but also of weaker ties, which potentially provide access to a rich array of resources</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">(Granovetter, 1973)</span><span xml:lang="en-CA">. Lin’s definition also broadens the spatial scope of social networks and the mobilization of resources, acknowledging that urban contexts fosters more culturally diverse social relations</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">(Fischer, 1982)</span><span xml:lang="en-CA">, and that support communities are physically dispersed, departing from more locally geographic definitions of social capital, grounded in localized communities</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">(eg, see Putnam, 2000)</span><span xml:lang="en-CA">. This definition also acknowledges that social capital is a multidimensional construct, involving several and different kinds of resources (emotional and material), which are predominantly derived from people’s social contacts (Owen and Videras, 2009).</span>

        In order to combine the social capital and social network approaches, this paper uses the concept of <span class="char-style-override-1">network capital</span>, defined by Wellman and Frank (2000) as the form of social capital that makes resources available through interpersonal ties, which assumes that the provision of network capital depends on the characteristics of each network member (or alter) and that the relational characteristics of each tie with a network member. From a travel behaviour perspective, the network capital approach reflects the variety of ties and spatial locations of network members, highlighting the role of transport in the development and maintenance of&#160;communities. As a consequence, the analysis broadens the definition of ‘community’ in terms of space (eg, beyond neighbours), support exchange (eg, economic but also emotional), or relationships (eg, beyond family and neighbours ties).

        <span xml:lang="en-CA">The study of the explicit impacts of transport on social networks is still in its</span> <span xml:lang="en-CA">early stages (Dugundji et&#160;al, 2008). Despite earlier studies that speculated on how the urban experience can be ‘narrowed’ by transport through separating communities from workplaces and insulating the world in between (Yago, 1983), more recent literature acknowledges the complex role of transport in urban social interactions (Axhausen, 2000). For example, Wellman</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">(2001)</span> <span xml:lang="en-CA">argues that transportation, communication, and computer networks can be considered to be manifestations of the social networks that connect people with each other as well as being factors that expand the geographic scope and size of the social networks. In fact, as Urry (2002;</span> <span xml:lang="en-CA">2003) argues, social sciences would need a ‘mobility turn’ that could concentrate further on the role of transport to acknowledge the roles (both positive and negative) that physical and corporeal travel plays in social life. This mobility turn would require not only a more solid theoretical framework, but it would also need better data to support an understanding of the role of transport in social life (Axhausen, 2005). Disentangling how transport influences social networks constitutes an important challenge for the discipline of travel behaviour, considering that current individualistic paradigms and tools do not account for the complexity of social activities and travel in urban cities (Axhausen, 2008).</span>

      <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">
        <span xml:lang="en-CA">In this context</span> <span xml:lang="en-CA">the role of social capital in travel behaviour—and network capital in particular—has gained attention, being recognized as a broader policy goal that may be achieved through the provision of accessibility and transport facilities (eg, Stanley and Vella-Brodrick, 2009). Urry (2002), for example, argues that fully active and engaged members of society require social capital within localities, and that the participation of such individuals involves transportation and mobility. In the same vein, Currie and Stanley (2008) claim that the role of transport in social capital has been overlooked, pointing out the need for a better understanding of how transport acts to address social disadvantage through the provision of mobility. In fact, these authors identify ‘plausible links’ between transport and ‘positive’ social interaction, such as the role of car dependence, spatial relations, copresence, and well-</span><span xml:lang="en-CA">being. However, the literature still tends to focus mostly on theoretical developments (eg,&#160;Doi et&#160;al,&#160;2008). As Stanley and Vella-Brodick (2009) note, little theoretical work has been undertaken on social capital and transport which could recognize the need for more explicit measures regarding social capital and community, and the role of social networks. In fact, as recent empirical efforts suggest, there is still a broad scope for research to quantify and identify the relevance of transport in people’s network capital</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">(eg, Farber and Páez, 2009; Hartell, 2008)</span><span xml:lang="en-CA">.</span>

        Data about personal networks were collected in two distinctive city neighbourhoods: <span class="char-style-override-1">Agüita de la Perdiz</span>, composed by lower–medium-income households (hereafter, LI), and <span class="char-style-override-1">La Virgen</span>, composed by higher–medium income residences (hereafter, HI). LI was created in 1950 by a land occupation performed by politically organized <span class="char-style-override-1">pobladores</span> who constructed their own neighbourhood, which then gave good levels of social organization. In its earliest years it looked like a shantytown; however, after sixty years of continuous occupation, and thanks to the self-construction and the public effort of urbanization, it has become an average lower–middle-class neighbourhood. HI was built in two stages. First, around the 1950s, two important city companies built houses for their professional staff. Later, during the 1970s and 1980s, the liberal professional and upper middle class built new houses in the area, consolidating the neighbourhood as it currently looks.
      </p>
      <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">
        The households of LI and HI are not extremely poor or wealthy; spatially, these two neighbourhoods are near each other and have good accessibility (around twenty minutes walking distance) to downtown Concepción, where most of the services and workplaces are located. In fact, the neighbourhoods were chosen to explore two different social and income contexts while controlling for spatial access to urban facilities. Figure 1 shows the locations of the neighbourhoods and of each respondent in the city.
      </p>
      <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">
        As expected from the income difference between these neighbourhoods, only 30% of the respondents living in LI have a car at home, which contrasts with 85% in HI. However, within each neighbourhood there are no relevant differences in the relationship between income and household car ownership, which is a very useful result to control for the effect of these two variables on the access to network capital.
      </p>
      <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">
        The two neighbourhoods also present very different patterns in terms of the mode of transport used for social visits. In fact, the proportion of car use is 22% in LI versus 72% in HI, whereas the proportion of public transport use is 72% in LI and 36% in HI. Walking was mentioned as a usual transport mode for visits by 35% of the respondents living in LI and 28% of those residing in HI. The similar shares of walking for visits also highlight the similarities between the neighbourhoods in terms of their urban context (ie, walkability).

Concretely, respondents named people who lived outside their household to whom they felt emotionally</span> <span class="char-style-override-1" xml:lang="en-CA">very close</span> <span xml:lang="en-CA">and</span> <span class="char-style-override-1" xml:lang="en-CA">somewhat close</span><span xml:lang="en-CA">.

The category ‘somewhat close’ consisted of “more than just casual acquaintances, but not very close people”. This emotional ‘closeness’ approach defines two aspects: strength of the tie (strong versus somewhat strong), and personal network ‘boundary’, excluding casual acquaintances.</span>

      <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">
        <span xml:lang="en-CA">Besides gathering data on sociodemographic attributes of respondents (egos), other aspects include alters’ age, relationship, gender, home location, and most frequent place of interaction with the ego. In addition, information was compiled about the communication and&#160;interaction patterns (face-to-face, socializing, telephone, e-mail) between the egos&#160;and each of the</span> <span xml:lang="en-CA">alters. The data also include personal network composition, involving the number of alters in terms of sociodemographics (eg, age, gender) and ego–alter relationship (eg, family member, friend). Respondents also recorded the connections and strength they believed to exist among their alters, which were used to study social network measures that have been found relevant in the past in similar data (Carrasco and Miller, 2009). These are</span><span xml:lang="en-US">:</span> <span xml:lang="en-CA">size (number of alters); density (ratio between the number of ties present in the network and the maximum possible);</span> <span xml:lang="en-CA">number of isolates (alters connected only to the ego); number of components (subgraphs that are connected within, but disconnected between, subgraphs, including isolates); number of cliques (defined as the maximal complete subgraph of three or more nodes); mean degree (mean number of ties linking each node); and mean Freeman’s betweenness (which accounts for the mean shortest paths between nodes).

        Finally, respondents were asked to identify both directions of social support: “to whom (from their networks) they have given or could give help” and “from whom (from their networks) they have received or could receive help”.

        The models were estimated using the software MLwiN (Rasbash et&#160;al, 2003), through a penalised quasi-likelihood (PQL) method. PQL makes an estimate using the joint posterior modes of both level coefficients given variance-covariance estimates, which are calculated using a normal approximation of the restricted likelihood. The coefficients calibrated using PQL correspond to approximate empirical Bayes estimates in the randomly varying level-1 coefficients, generalized linear squares estimators in the level-2 coefficients, and approximate maximum likelihood estimators of the variance and covariance parameters.

        Table 1 presents the mean value of the proportions of alters who have common characteristics in each network.

Note that these proportions do not add up to 100% since the data instrument allowed respondents to identify alters with more than one role (eg, both neighbours and family members).

        As table 2 shows, personal networks in LI have a statistically significant higher density and mean degree compared with those from HI. Conversely, egos living in HI reported twice as many isolates as their counterparts in LI. These results are consistent with the previous results of network composition in LI, since immediate family alters may have more connections between them than friends. At the same time, the level of subgrouping is very similar between both neighbourhoods, considering that the difference in the number of components is mainly due to the number of isolates, and the similarity in the number of cliques among them.

In fact, besides the similarities in the mean contacts in the province—possibly due to low-income egos having relatives dwelling in the countryside—personal networks in HI tend to have a greater number of alters at the national and international scale.

        A key aim of this analysis is to study the relevance of car ownership in support exchanges.

In fact, social contacts living outside the province (in the country or abroad) are less likely to give or receive emotional support than those living closer, with no differences in the probability of ego–alter emotional support&#160;exchange for most local categories (ie, neighbourhood, city, and Greater Concepción Area).

        Regarding car ownership, respondents with a car at home have a higher likelihood of receiving or giving emotional support, especially those living in HI.

In other words, having a car could facilitate the exchange of emotional support, although with some differences between the neighbourhoods. Yet, the results from M1 also have to be understood in the context of the empirical findings from the previous sections of the frequency and spatiality of contacts. Thus, car ownership would not be related to frequency of interaction or spatial scope of networks, but possibly to greater time–space flexibility to reach these contacts. Further research is needed to explore this hypothesis.

This methodology proved to be a useful perspective for capturing empirically the role of transport in social support exchanges, providing the opportunity to study the relevance of time and space in social contacts. The rich dataset employed herein is capable of capturing the respondents’ personal network and their spatial and temporal characteristics (ego–alter distances and frequency of interactions), serving as a ‘natural’ framework with which to study the role of transport in network capital.
      </p>
      <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">
        The empirical illustration concentrated on studying the role of car ownership by comparing the network capital levels between two neighbourhoods with different income averages but similar accessibility to jobs and urban services. The first step compared personal network characteristics to assess the variety and quality of access to potential resources. The results suggest that, despite their similar average sizes, there were differences in their composition, tie–node structure, and spatiality.
      </p>
      <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">
        Personal network characteristics in time and space were studied as a second step towards understanding ego–alter flows of support, conceiving car ownership as a potential facilitator of space and time constraints for social exchanges. The results suggest that car ownership does not directly influence the frequencies of ego–alter social interaction, and that personal network spatiality is influenced mainly by income, not by car ownership.
      </p>
      <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">
        In the final step we studied the relevance of car ownership to network capital, showing differences depending on the type of social support. The results suggest that having a car seems to be more relevant for emotional support than for material resources, which seem to be driven mainly by income. Then, the role of car ownership in network capital is mediated by the individual’s income context, emphasizing the need to acknowledge the multidimensionality of social support.
      </p>
      <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">
        <span xml:lang="en-CA">All these results highlight recent warnings in the literature about overly simplistic indicators (eg, mere car ownership) related to the role of transport on social exclusion</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">(Johnson et&#160;al, 2010)</span><span xml:lang="en-CA">. In fact, the empirical findings support the view that having a car at home does not necessarily imply a difference in people’s network capital. Furthermore, they caution about the complexity of assessing the role of transport in social capital, considering the differences in the spatial and temporal configuration of personal networks between the two neighbourhoods. For example, the locality of the personal networks of low-income egos may suggest an adaptation process due to their lower levels of accessibility and a potential variety of social resources.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">
        In addition, distinguishing between the relevance of car and income in social support exchange could contribute to the debate about boosting network capital through transport policies. At a first view, the secondary role of transport in personal network characteristics and their embedded social support levels would suggest a much more central role for redistributive policies compared with transport policies. The exception seems to be the relevance of cars in emotional support, possibly due to the capability of cars to offer better time–space convenience. Yet, these results also suggest that people living in LI may have adapted to lower levels of accessibility to people, due to the higher space–time constraints they experience using public transport, especially considering their lack in the variety of resources both in space (mostly local) and types or relationships (mostly family). This issue is particularly relevant in the Chilean context, where most of the population depend on public transport to perform their activities, which contrasts with government policies that have historically prioritized investment in private transport. In this sense, the provision of better spatial access to social networks through transport needs to be articulated with other policies addressing social vulnerability. In the same vein, the focus of these policies should be towards lower income groups (and then public transport), which have much lower network capital levels in the context studied.
      </p>
      <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">
        From a research perspective, future efforts should concentrate on further disentangling the effects of income and car in social support, which do not necessarily affect all types of social support evenly. Beyond income, the relevance of the urban context and the role&#160;of&#160;public transport need to be studied, going beyond neighbourhoods with good public transport coverage and access to the city’s main amenities. In addition, these effects need to be studied in different national contexts to assess other particularities which are difficult to measure explicitly with the methods employed in the paper.
      </p>
      <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">
        In sum, although transport seems to have different impacts depending on the type of social support, its magnitude and relevance are still open questions. Nonetheless, the social network methods and theory presented in this paper constitute a useful approach for capturing the multidimensionality of network capital, providing a good starting point from which to capture the complexities of the individual’s social context, both in space and in time, and their link with transport policies.
