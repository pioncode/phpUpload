'Shallow or deep Europeanisation? The uneven impact of EU cohesion policy on the regional and local authorities in Poland',
'With this paper I aim at refining the understanding of mechanisms of postaccession
Europeanisation in the new member states by investigating the impact of EU cohesion
policy on the Polish subnational policy actors involved in its implementation. Drawing
on recent empirical evidence on the influence of EU cohesion policy in three areas—
administrative capacity, strategic planning, and governance—I show that adjustment to
the EU cohesion policy norms initially tends to be stimulated by cost–benefit calculation
or constraint, which may involve ‘shallow’ adjustment. However, the study also reveals
that over time, provided that EU-imported norms are in line with the actors’ preferences,
socialisation and learning mechanisms become more prominent. Moreover, I demonstrate
that the subnational impact of EU cohesion policy remains uneven and differentiated
depending on the actors’ preferences, attitudes, and capacity.

'Community development corporations, policy networks, and the rescaling of community development advocacy',
'Some argue that, as place-bound, development-oriented entities dependent upon capital, community development corporations (CDCs) are ineffective political agents beyond the boundaries of the disadvantaged neighborhoods they serve. In response I ask: how have CDCs worked through policy networks to rescale the &#8216;spaces of engagement&#8217; for community development policy beyond the local? Data gathered through document analysis, a survey, and interviews point to three distinct phases of the CDC rescaling project: (1) linking the local through a national network; (2) expanding spaces of engagement through state policy networks; and (3) a national network of networks. CDC policy networks have had uneven success in establishing their legitimacy, proving CDC effectiveness as agents of local economic development, overcoming &#8216;militant particularisms&#8217;, and mobilizing both the state and capital. CDCs can expand their spaces of engagement beyond the local through policy networks if they successfully develop boundary-spanning relations, defend their place-based agenda, combat essentialization through performance measurement, strengthen their state networks, and reimagine their national rescaling project.

'Governing climate change transnationally: assessing the evidence from a database of sixty initiatives',
'With this paper we present an analysis of sixty transnational governance initiatives and assess the implications for our understanding of the roles of public and private actors, the legitimacy of governance &#8216;beyond&#8217; the state, and the North&#8211;South dimensions of governing climate change. In the first part of the paper we examine the notion of transnational governance and its applicability in the climate change arena, reflecting on the history and emergence of transnational governance initiatives in this issue area and key areas of debate. In the second part of the paper we present the findings from the database and its analysis. Focusing on three core issues, the roles of public and private actors in governing transnationally, the functions that such initiatives perform, and the ways in which accountability for governing global environmental issues might be achieved, we suggest that significant distinctions are emerging in the universe of transnational climate governance which may have considerable implications for the governing of global environmental issues. In conclusion, we reflect on these findings and the subsequent consequences for the governance of climate change.

'The transnational regime complex for climate change',
'In climate change, as in other areas, recent years have produced a &#8216;Cambrian explosion&#8217; of transnational institutions, standards, financing arrangements, and programs. As a result, climate governance has become complex, fragmented, and decentralized, operating without central coordination. Most studies of climate governance&#160;focus&#160;on&#160;inter&#173;state institutions. In contrast, I map a different realm of climate change governance:&#160;the&#160;diverse array of transnational schemes. I analyze this emerging system in terms of two theoretical frame&#173;works&#160;developed to describe, explain, and evaluate complex governance arrangements&#8212;regime complex theory and polycentric governance theory&#8212;revealing&#160;fruitful avenues for positive and normative research. I conclude by arguing that the benefits of institutional complexity could be increased, and the costs reduced, through nonhierarchical &#8216;orchestration&#8217; of climate change governance, in which international organizations or other appropriate authorities support and steer transnational schemes that further global public interests.

'Disrupting the public&#8211;private distinction: excavating the government of carbon markets post-Copenhagen',
'This paper draws upon the recent carbon market turmoil to understand how the private realm is imagined in global climate governance. Instead of asking which entities (eg, public or private authorities) govern the carbon economy, we draw attention to the procedures (eg, caps on emissions, techniques of verification, or performance standards) by which carbon markets are made thinkable and governable as administrative domains. When focusing on these &#8216;calculative practices&#8217;, carbon market governance does not signify a retreat of the state. Rather, in this paper we argue that the involvement of nonstate actors in the governance of carbon markets represents a transformation of political rule that replaces formal and hierarchical techniques of government with more indirect regimes of calculation. From this vantage point carbon market governance emerges as an expression of a changing rationality of government where the private realm becomes elevated from being a passive terrain to be acted upon and instead turned into an entity that is both object and subject of government.

'Privatization and intermunicipal contracting:
        the US local government experience 1992&#8211;2007',
'Local government scholars are giving increasing attention to market solutions to urban service delivery. Intermunicipal contracting and privatization are two market approaches to reaching economies of scale. Using national data on over one thousand municipalities from across the United States for the 1992&#8211;2007 period, we explore the differences between intermunicipal contracting and privatization and assess how the use of these market approaches relates to efficiency, scale, and public engagement factors. Using probit models for each of four survey years (1992, 1997, 2002, 2007), we find these market solutions are only partial responses to the problem of regional coordination and exhibit important differences with respect to place, management, and political concerns. These market solutions exhibit limited efficiency, equity, and voice benefits.

'Popular perception of urban transformation through megaevents: understanding support for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi',
'With the increasing number and impact of events hosted by cities, understanding the nature of popular support for them and the resulting urban transformations is a crucial task. I examine residents&#8217; perceptions of the preparations for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, asking how support differs across social groups and what factors predict support. I find that negative impacts from preparations dominate public opinion, but that there is nevertheless a solid support base for the event. Support tends to be strongest among non-Russians, the younger generation, and residents who have good knowledge of the preparations. Perception of positive impacts&#8212;in particular, expected image improvement&#8212;is the strongest predictor of support, while perception of negative impacts shows a much weaker association with support. I conclude that delivering on the positive aspects of events might be more important for administrations than minimizing the negative side effects.

'Building environmental governance in Bosnia-Herzegovina: Europeanisation and transnational assistance in the context of limited statehood',
'With this paper I seek to identify the conditions under which a shift occurs from hierarchical decision making towards new modes of environmental governance in a case of weak statehood (Bosnia-Herzegovina), where an external agency (the EU) exerts significant influence alongside foreign consultants and international financial institutions (the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#8212;EBRD). The Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) undertaken as part of the development of the trans-European road network across the country are used here as case studies for examining emerging patterns of environmental governance in a state under the shadow of EU conditionality. The data suggest that whilst over a period of time the adoption of new EU-compliant formal procedures and frameworks (eg, EIA laws) does seem to be generating new modes of governance interaction and citizen involvement, the impact is contingent upon the critical didactic role played by (in this case) the EBRD in making the formal procedures effective and in building knowledge capacity within the state administration. Thus, a simple correlation between EU conditionality and substantive political change cannot be assumed, particularly where state agencies possess limited policy knowledge and nonstate actors (environmental NGOs) lack mobilisation capacity.

'How climate change became a business risk: analyzing nonstate agency in global climate politics',
'Climate change is widely acknowledged as a key business risk. Companies around the globe are taking action to mitigate their carbon emissions, develop climate-friendly products and services, and prepare for the negative impacts of climate change for their operations. Financial investors, on their part, are becoming more concerned about business responses to climate change and begin to demand concrete risk management strategies. In this context an increasing number of private initiatives are seeking to change business behaviour in a more sustainable direction. Key instruments used are governance by disclosure. This paper explores the agency of nonstate actors in manufacturing climate change into a key business risk, a development that enabled the use of disclosure-based governance mechanisms in global climate politics.

'Transnational public<i>&#8211;</i>private partnerships&#8217; performance in water governance: institutional design matters',
'Transnational public&#8211;private partnerships (PPPs) are new forms of governance that have caught the interest of researchers in recent years. While the literature tends to portray PPPs as loosely institutionalized forms of governance, we argue that PPPs&#8217; institutional design varies and matters for their effectiveness. We aim to demonstrate that a high degree of institutionalization (obligation, precision, delegation) is relevant in cases that involve collective action problems&#8212;that is, for those PPPs that have to deal with distributional conflict, cheating, or free-riding. To substantiate our argument, we compare and analyze the performance of three transnational water partnerships (not to be confused with municipal for-profit PPPs). Our results confirm that a high degree of institutionalization tends to be important for those water partnerships that implement costly projects. It is less important for those that focus on the comparatively undemanding task of exchanging and disseminating knowledge and best practice in water management and governance.
