'Leaders, followers, and laggards: adoption of the US Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement in California',
'Limited quantitative research has been devoted to voluntary climate actions at the local level. It is unclear why some cities act as leaders in the fight against climate change, some act as followers, while others remain laggards.&#160;This study tests hypotheses about local climate proactiveness to mitigate climate change. Applying a survival analysis to California cities&#8217; adoption of the US Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, I examine the association between cities&#8217; adoption of the agreement, a range of cities&#8217; characteristics, and the behavior of neighboring jurisdictions. The results suggest important roles of the overall capacity of a local jurisdiction, its staff capacity with relevant expertise, average household income level, and voter preferences. Study results also suggest the importance of local traffic conditions and the positive peer effect.

'Institutional entrepreneurship in hostile settings:<br>
        health and social care partnerships in Scotland, 2002&#8211;05',
'Using institutional entrepreneurship theory, I examine the emergence of a novel partnership model in Scotland between 2002 and 2005 to deliver health and social care services. Utilising a qualitative methodology based on interviews and secondary data, I investigate how health and social care managers in a large urban city area acted as institutional entrepreneurs. By engaging in institutional work at a microlevel, mesolevel, and macrolevel, these managers overcame institutional pressure to implement a centrally mandated partnership model advocated by the then Scottish Executive. The study suggests that institutional entrepreneurship is a specific form of change management that can provide unique insights into the political and negotiative processes involved in implementing divergent change in the face of local and national resistance and offers guidance to policy makers and practitioners in framing and implementing change initiatives.

'Making government liquid: shifts in governance using financialisation as a political device',
'The financialised character of contemporary rationalities of public governance has been the subject of increased attention within a range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary fields. With this paper we propose a particular analytical framework, focused on the notion of &#8216;governance devices&#8217;, for understanding the processes that underpin financialised governance and, more fundamentally, maintain the connections between markets and politics. Deploying three distinct cases, we indicate that these devices transcend divisions between the actor and the device and create a different form of agency&#8212;an assemblage. We argue that understanding such assemblages&#8212;their emergence, activity, and, frequently, their failures&#8212;opens a window on analysing the nature of contemporary forms of financialised governance as a technosocial system. In so doing we suggest that the governance devices approach can offer a way of challenging contemporary governance orthodoxies, retracing governments&#8217; lost responsibilities and resurfacing their &#8216;core tasks&#8217;.

'Mitigating conflict and violence in African cities',
'The process of urbanisation has historically been associated with both socioeconomic development and social strain. Although there is little evidence that urbanisation per se increases the likelihood of conflict or violence in a country, in recent decades Africa has experienced exceptional rates of urban population growth in a context of economic stagnation and poor governance, producing conditions conducive to social unrest and violence. In order to improve urban security in the years ahead, the underlying risk factors must be addressed, including urban poverty, inequality, and fragile political institutions. This, in turn, requires improving urban governance in the region by strengthening the capacity of local government institutions, addressing the complex political dynamics that impede effective urban planning and management, and cultivating integrated development strategies that involve cooperation between various tiers and spheres of government&#160;and&#160;civil society.

'Water scarcity, conflict, and migration: a comparative analysis and reappraisal',
'How should we characterise the relations between environmental scarcity, conflict, and migration? Most academic and policy analyses conclude that scarcities of environmental resources can have significant impacts upon conflict and migration, and claim or imply that within the context of accelerating global environmental changes these impacts are likely to become more significant still. Many analyses admittedly recognise that these impacts are often indirect rather than direct and that there exist multiple &#8216;drivers&#8217; of conflict and migration, of which environmental stresses are but one. We argue that even these qualifications do not go far enough, however: they still overstate the current and likely future significance of environmental changes and stresses in contributing to conflict
        and migration and underemphasise a far more important causal pathway&#8212;from
        conflict and migration to environmental vulnerabilities. These arguments are advanced via a comparative analysis of water&#8211;migration&#8211;conflict linkages in Cyprus and Israel and the West Bank and Gaza.

'India&#8217;s ecocity? Environment, urbanisation, and mobility in the making of Lavasa',
'In a context of rapid urbanisation in the Global South the potential of ecocities to provide sustainable development is hotly debated within academic and policy circles. This paper will contribute to this debate by referring to Lavasa, India&#8217;s largest planned &#8216;hill city&#8217;, a fifth of the size of Mumbai. Mentioned in the influential McKinsey report as an emerging global city, Lavasa, the first &#8216;sustainable&#8217; city developed in the Mumbai<i>&#8211;</i>Pune region, attempts to deal with urbanisation, environment, and migration in very particular ways. Yet, it has been riddled with controversies since its inception, and construction has been interrupted by the courts a number of times for alleged environmental violations. Using Lavasa as an example, I will examine the rise and rise of ecocities in India through their legal and policy context. I will argue that future ecocities in India run the danger of prioritising economic development over environmental sustainability in the absence&#160;of strong legal enforcement and monitoring of environmental performance. I conclude that&#160;strong environmental policy framing and regulation are crucial in this context if new planned cities in India are to have any potential in addressing the challenges of rapid urbanisation and sustainable development.

'Migration as adaptation? Exploring the scope for coordinating environmental and migration policies in the European Union',
'We explore the links between environmental change, human migration, and adaptation in the relatively mature governance system of the European Union (EU). It is shown that these connections are limited and, when made, tend to be security focused. This situation inhibits scope for migration (both internally within states and internationally between states) to be understood as a form of adaptation to economic, social, political, demographic, and environmental change. We assess the underlying dynamics of EU environmental policy, note the main modes and instruments used, and identify some of&#160;the chief dynamics in this policy field. Finally, conclusions are drawn with respect to how, in future, the EU might interact with nonmember states on environment and migration-related issues.

'Human migration and displacement in the context of adaptation to climate change: the Cancun Adaptation Framework and potential for future action',
'The first-time-ever agreed-upon text on migration, displacement, and planned relocation in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) climate negotiations process was informed by recent empirical research, and will shape how human mobility is dealt with under adaptation. Migration, displacement, and planned relocation feature in the text of the Cancun Adaptation Framework as technical cooperation issues which highlight activities that help to guide adaptation funding. Human mobility in the UNFCCC context is distinct from other policy fora&#8212;like international protocols and expanding mandates of existing frameworks such as the 1951 Geneva Convention. Operationally oriented solutions and discussions are moving forward in a UNFCCC process through the Cancun Adaptation Framework [paragraph&#160;14(f )], the Climate Finance and the Adaptation Committee, and the Subsidiary Body on Implementation&#8217;s Work Program on Loss and Damage. These and other policy processes catalyze nationally and regionally driven work on the topics of migration, displacement, and planned relocation in the context of climate change.

'Environmental change and migration: legal and political frameworks',
'With this paper I focus on international legal norms and organizational roles and relations applicable to migration induced by environmental change. I examine movements stemming directly and indirectly from environmental factors related to climate change&#8212;including, for example, movements resulting from intensified drought and desertification affecting livelihoods, rising sea levels, intensified acute natural disasters, and competition for resources that result in intensified conflict. The analysis focuses on the extent to which legal and institutional responses affect patterns of mobility, especially in slow-onset situations,&#160;and the extent to which governance, more generally, affects the likelihood that people will migrate as a result of environmental factors, especially in humanitarian emergencies. I conclude that immigration policies, governance, and the level of development in affected countries play a crucial role in determining the responses to natural hazards and conflict. They also help determine if migration poses technical or managerial challenges or presents political challenges. Given the current gaps in appropriate migration policies, more attention needs to be placed on identifying and testing new frameworks for managing potential movements. Attention needs to be given to both sides of the environment and migration nexus: (1) identifying adaptation strategies that allow people to remain where they currently live and work; and (2) identifying migration and relocation strategies that protect people&#8217;s lives and livelihoods when they are unable to remain.'

'Migration and environmental change in international governance: the case of the European Union',
'With this paper we analyse and assess the role of the European Union (EU) in the governance of migration linked to environmental change. We trace the emergence of migration linked to environmental change as an issue on the EU agenda and examine both issue definition and the institutional location of EU responses. The EU is identified as a particularly significant potential actor in the broader debate about environmental change and migration, as it is the world&#8217;s most developed form of regionalised supranational governance with responsibilities in the areas of both environmental and migration policy, albeit with little connection made, as yet, between the two. We show that the relationship between migration and environmental change emerged as an issue for the EU&#8217;s foreign policy community before becoming part of the EU&#8217;s &#8216;Global Approach to Migration and Mobility&#8217;. We argue that there is a compelling argument for consideration of migration and environmental change in the context of adaptation and development policies, as well as broader debate and contestation of the meaning of these policies. This involves a rethink of some of the precepts and practices informing EU migration and asylum policy.

'Migration, environmental change, and the &#8216;challenges of governance&#8217;',
'This paper provides a framework for the theme issue by exploring links between environmental change and human migration. We review evidence that demonstrates that millions of people have moved or are likely to move <i>towards</i> and not <i>away from</i> environmental risk and hazard by moving from rural areas to rapidly growing urban areas. Moreover, some people may choose not to move or be unable to move. Environmental change may further erode household resources in such a way that migration becomes less and not more likely, even in the context of quite significant environmental change posing serious threats to the sustainability of livelihoods. This creates the possibility that populations will be trapped in areas that expose them to serious risk. We argue that the links between environmental change, migration, and governance are of significant importance, and directly influence the modes and efficacy of migration governance at different levels.
