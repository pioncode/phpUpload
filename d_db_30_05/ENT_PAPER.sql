'From loom to machine: Tibetan aprons and the configuration of place',
'In this paper I examine how objects become connected to place in complex and contradictory ways. Over the past ten to fifteen years, rapid transformations in Chinese manufacturing and transportation networks have significantly altered the production, marketing, and consumption of commodities made in the Tibet Autonomous Region and traded in Kalimpong, India, and Kathmandu, Nepal. In an attempt to connect the ethnographic study of material culture with more macrolevel processes of geoeconomic change, I begin the piece with an examination of the changing production, materials, and styles of a very specific commodity, the Tibetan women&#8217;s apron. I then explore traders&#8217; narratives about the values of handmade, machine-made, wool, and synthetic commodities, arguing that we ought to look beyond dichotomies of &#8216;old&#8217; versus &#8216;new&#8217; or &#8216;authentic&#8217; versus &#8216;inauthentic&#8217; objects to show in detail how the attachment of commodities to representations of <i>place</i> figures importantly in the contemporary study both of globalization and uneven development. Finally, I suggest that Karl Marx&#8217;s notion of dead labor is useful in analyzing the recent move towards the revitalization of Tibetan wool for both the domestic Chinese industry and the global tourist industry.

'A critique of everyday international relations: the case of cultural pluralism in Singapore and Vancouver',
'In the context of Singapore and Vancouver strategically repositioning themselves as gateway cities between Asian and North American markets, I focus on Singapore&#8217;s multiracialism and Vancouver&#8217;s multiculturalism to frame how people encounter &#8216;the international&#8217; along racialized and cultural lines in their daily lives. Building on an emerging appetite for everyday life theory in international relations, I look at Henri Lefebvre&#8217;s work on alienation to explore how cultural pluralism policies structure everyday life through what I call &#8216;everyday borders of the international&#8217;. This will reveal how the interrelationships between daily life, political platforms like these policies, and broader political and economic structures shape different everyday encounters of the international.

'City becoming world: Nancy, Lefebvre, and the
        global&#8211;urban imagination',
'It is part of the self-conception of the contemporary era that the world is becoming increasingly <i>global</i> and <i>urban</i>. This paper explores the <i>global&#8211;urban</i> imagination in works by Jean-Luc Nancy and Henri Lefebvre. Both Nancy and Lefebvre understand globalization as a fundamentally violent and unequal process that unfolds through the uneven expansion of a particular sort of urban space. They both strive to articulate a critical stance towards this process by opposing globalization to the idea of <i>mondialisation</i> or world forming. While their respective approaches differ in important ways, they both provide indispensible critical tools for conceptualizing the urban planet and its political possibilities. Their positions are briefly contrasted to the conservative imagery of the urban planet as techno utopia that was produced at Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China.

'Illegality in settlement heterotopias: a study of frontier governance in the Brazilian Amazon',
'It is often argued that various forms of illegality persist in the Brazilian Amazon because of weak frontier governance. However, very little is understood about how this governance can be strengthened in the context of social and spatial change in a way that will counter illegality. Drawing on the concept of heterotopias, as discussed by Michel Foucault, and the life history of an illegal logger in an agrarian reform settlement project in the state of Par&#225;, this paper approaches frontier governance by conceptualising the &#8216;settlement heterotopia&#8217; as a real, lived-in place in which the space that makes up various state and nonstate actors&#8217; sites of action interact and continually rearrange power relations. This rearrangement process may or may not work to legitimise illegality and, therefore, strengthening frontier governance involves a process by which collaborative power relations emerge and residents decide to work with the state instead of alongside illegality.

'&#8216;Worlds of justification&#8217; in the politics and practices of urban regeneration',
'A considerable body of research has developed on processes of neoliberal urban regeneration and gentrification. On the one hand, there are many political economy accounts emphasising the role of economic capital in processes of urban change and gentrification. On the other hand, there is a wealth of governmentality studies on the art of government that fail to explain how ungovernable subjects develop. Similarly, within gentrification studies there are many accounts on the role of changing consumer lifestyles and defining gentrification, but less concern with the governance processes between actors in urban regeneration and gentrification. Yet such issues are of considerable importance given the role of the state in urban regeneration and dependence on private capital. This paper utilises the French Pragmatist approach of Boltanski and Th&#233;venot to examine a case study state-led gentrification project. Boltanski and Th&#233;venot argue that social coordination occurs by way of actors working through broader value-laden &#8216;worlds of justification&#8217; that underpin processes of argumentation and coordination. The examined case study is a deprived area within an English city where a major state-led gentrification programme has been introduced. The rationale for the programme is based on the assumption that reducing deprivation relies upon substantially increasing the number of higher income earners. The paper concludes that market values have overridden broader civic values in the negotiation process, with this intensifying as the state internalised market crisis tendencies within the project. More broadly, there is a need for French Pragmatism to be more sensitive to the spatial processes of social coordination, which can be achieved through critical engagement with recent concepts of &#8216;assemblages&#8217;.

'Contemporary Western war and the idea of humanity',
'In the post-cold-war period Western military force has been deployed in the name of protecting humanity despite the obvious paradox of trying to achieve such protection through means that undermine this very aim. This has generated much debate about the merits of (humanitarian) intervention. In this paper I aim not to take a position in this debate but, rather, to examine its terms. I seek to draw out what is assumed, implied, and obscured by this debate. I explore the larger issue of how the framing of the debate in terms of protecting humanity works to exclude the apparent beneficiaries from the realm of politics and generates the demand for an urgent, violent resolution to what is produced as an ethical dilemma. I start by exploring the ways in which post-cold-war Western war has been represented as war for humanity. I then draw out how critical scholarship has brought into view the fact that the apparently universal category of humanity is marked by hierarchy, and thus undermines itself. I end by arguing that the idea of humanity provides an ethical framing which both relies on and responds to the problematic association of politics with intelligibility, leaving us with a predicament that cannot be resolved.

'Dwelling as marking and claiming',
'The aim of this paper is to put forth a conception of dwelling as a practice of marking and claiming. By this I mean that dwelling does not designate a passive condition but a mode of human practice. By suggesting that dwelling is <i>marking</i> I am highlighting the intimate relationship between dwelling and building. While in &#8220;Building dwelling thinking&#8221; (in <i>Poetry, Language, Thought</i> 1971, Harper and Row, New York) Heidegger encourages the reader to look beyond building in order to see how it is grounded in dwelling, his emphasis on <i>techne</i> in other work illustrates that he sees building and dwelling as two sides of the same coin. Not only must we dwell in order to build, but we must build in order to dwell. To dwell means to build and building is how we constitute our dwelling. At the same time, I argue that dwelling is only ever a claim. While Heidegger always understands human action as limited by our temporal situation (beings that are thrown and that face death), his later work elaborates this context through the conception of the fourfold. The fourfold emphasises how marking (as building) is always undermined and overwhelmed by the spatial/temporal unfolding of the world itself. Thus, while mortals must build in order to dwell, all such buildings are <i>claims</i>&#8212;that is, assertions, allegations, and wagers announced in the face of a relentlessly moving world. The argument is developed by examining three Heideggerian concepts&#8212;the <i>Augenblick</i>, <i>techne</i>, and the fourfold&#8212;each of which contributes to this particular notion of dwelling.

'State sovereignty, bioethics, and political geographies: the practice of medicine under the Khmer Rouge',
'This paper combines insights from political philosophy, bioethics, and political geography to examine the practice of medicine by the Khmer Rouge during the Cambodian genocide. Through a discussion of both destructive and constructive health-related policies and practices enacted by the Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979, this paper documents how the practice of medicine provides a broader understanding of state sovereignty and the right to live or to let die. In so doing this paper contributes to our understanding in two areas: first, to the specific geographies of the Cambodian genocide and, second, the politics surrounding the calculated management of life and death.

'Remapping the border: taxation, territory, and (trans)national identity at the Mexico&#8211;Guatemala border',
'This paper examines how rural communities on a clandestine road crossing the Mexico&#8211;Guatemala border stake claim over this route while delegitimizing state control. Each community delimits its control by erecting a cadena, or chain, across its section of the road, from which it levies tolls on cross-border contraband. The cadenas shape political, economic, and cultural geography by instituting a local sovereign system of morality, economy, and legality. As border residents reimagine and rematerialize the border by displacing it from the geopolitical line to their cadenas, they mark their claims to this space. In a region where the majority of border flows occur through clandestine routes, residents contest the power of the nation-state to determine the border, sovereignty, belonging, and transregional development. Simultaneously, however, residents&#8217; border practices mimetically reproduce the relation between territory, power, and identity. I argue that the margins of the state can be critical junctures for examining how everyday people and state actors continuously negotiate and reconfigure the shifting materializations and meanings of territory, state power, and (trans)national space.

'Mapping children&#8217;s politics: the promise of articulation and the limits of nonrepresentational theory',
'Reflecting wider debates in the discipline, recent scholarship in children&#8217;s geographies has focused attention on the meanings of the political. While supportive of work that opens up new avenues for conceptualizing politics beyond the liberal rational subject, we provide a critique of research methods which delink politics from historical context and relations of power. Focusing on the use of nonrepresentational theory as a research methodology, the paper points to the limits of this approach for children&#8217;s political formation as well as for sustained scholarly collaboration. We argue instead for a politics of articulation, in the double sense of communication and connection. An empirical case study is used as an illustrative example.

'State encounters',
'Much has been made in recent years of the need to promote anthropological understandings of &#8216;the state&#8217;. Work in this area has tended to focus on either (1) the peopled aspects of state bureaucracies or (2) the effect of &#8216;the state&#8217; on the everyday lives of its citizens. Some authors have also begun to move beyond these concerns by examining the ways in which the actions of state agents can affect the everyday lives of citizens and how citizens can reach back to influence the peopled qualities of &#8216;the state&#8217;. My aim in this paper is to examine the sociospatial encounters between what may be considered as state agents and citizens. In doing so I seek to: undermine the idea that there is a fixed boundary between what is considered to be &#8216;the state&#8217; and what is viewed as civil society; illustrate how the identities of state agents and citizens are forged in relation to one another; show how these peopled encounters can be used by state elites as a means of promoting neoliberal agendas. As a way of grounding these conceptual concerns, I draw on some recent empirical work that I have conducted on Citizens Advice, the organisation that has worked since 1939 as a provider of all manner of welfare advice to the citizens of the UK. I conclude by emphasising that states&#8212;commonly conceived of as stable and enduring organisations that structure everyday life&#8212;are, in fact, in a continual state of emergence.
