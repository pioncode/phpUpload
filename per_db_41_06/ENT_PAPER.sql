'Complexity of images: experimental and computational estimates compared',
'We tested whether visual complexity can be modeled through the use of parameters relevant to known mechanisms of visual processing. In psychophysical experiments observers ranked the complexity of two groups of stimuli: 15 unfamiliar Chinese hieroglyphs and 24 outline images of well-known common objects. To predict image complexity, we considered: (i)&#160;spatial characteristics of the images, (ii)&#160;spatial-frequency characteristics, (iii)&#160;a combination of spatial and Fourier properties, and (iv)&#160;the size of the image encoded as a JPEG file. For hieroglyphs the highest correlation was obtained when complexity was calculated as the product of the squared spatial-frequency median and the image area. This measure accounts for the larger number of lines, strokes, and local periodic patterns in the hieroglyphs. For outline objects the best predictor of the experimental data was complexity estimated as the number of turns in the image, as Attneave (1957 <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology</i> <b>53</b> 221&#8211; 227) obtained for his abstract outlined images. Other predictors of complexity gave significant but lower correlations with the experimental ranking. We conclude that our modeling measures can be used to estimate the complexity of visual images but for different classes of images different measures of complexity may be required.

'Perceptions of dominance following glimpses of faces and&#160;bodies',
'Dominance is one of the most ecologically important social traits that humans express and perceive. Here, we examined perceivers&#8217; capacity to judge dominance under physical and temporal constraints. In study&#160;1, dominant, neutral, and submissive poses of otherwise non-expressive faces and impoverished facial outlines were judged after exposure for 27&#160;ms, 40&#160;ms, 94&#160;ms, or at a self-paced rate (approximately 2000&#160;ms). Perceivers&#8217; judgments of dominance were significantly more accurate than chance guessing for exposures of 40&#160;ms and greater, with no significant increase in accuracy given additional viewing time. In study&#160;2, we replaced faces with bodies and figural outlines of bodies. Perceivers&#8217; judgments were again better than chance for exposures of 40&#160;ms and greater, but significant increases in accuracy were observed for durations of 94&#160;ms and at a self-paced rate. Finally, in study 3, we combined studies 1 and&#160;2 to allow comparisons across stimuli. Results showed that judgments of dominance from the faces were significantly more accurate than were those of the bodies, and judgments of full stimuli were more accurate than were those of outlines. These data extend our knowledge of the efficient and accurate perception of social cues from nonverbal behavior.

'Effects of luminance on dynamic random-dot correlogram evoked visual potentials',
'Although dynamic random-dot correlogram evoked visual potentials (DRDC-VEPs) are a three-decade-old method to detect the cortical binocularity in humans and animals, our knowledge of the influence of fundamental stimulus parameters and the underlying cerebral processing mechanisms has remained limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of luminance on DRDC-VEPs in adults. The variability and detectability of DRDC-VEPs were investigated under different stimulus luminance conditions with neutral density filters. Our results have demonstrated that DRDC-VEPs can be evoked in a wide luminance range, and the response amplitude was practically independent of luminance between 4.75&#160;cd&#160;m<i>&#8211;2</i> and 0.015&#160;cd&#160;m<i>&#8211;2</i>, while DRDC-VEP latencies showed a strong linear correlation with log luminance. There is, however, a limit (0.06&#160;cd&#160;m<i>&#8211;2</i> ) below which DRDC-VEPs are not reliably recordable. Luminance reduction-induced delays in DRDC-VEP latencies cannot be explained simply by retinal mechanisms, since their regression slope does not follow the course of electroretinogram and cortical evoked potential latencies. Luminance independence of DRDC-VEP amplitude suggests that binocular correlation-processing cortical neurons receive input predominantly from the magnocellular visual pathway.

'Effects of band-pass spatial frequency filtering of face and&#160;object images on the amplitude of N170',
'Previous studies have suggested that physiological responses are greatest and face recognition performance is best when a band of middle relative spatial frequencies (SFs) is included in stimuli. Conversely, behavioural data suggest that object recognition performance shows comparatively little effect of SF variations. Here, we examine the effects of SF filtering on the amplitude of the N170 ERP component when participants are shown images of faces and objects. Our findings show that with face stimuli the amplitude of N170 exhibits a band-pass modulation function, with responses to&#160;middle SFs (around 11 cycles per face) being statistically indistinguishable from responses to full-band faces. In&#160;contrast to faces, object stimuli elicited a relatively flat function across much of&#160;the spectrum. However, for both faces and objects, middle spatial frequencies were sufficient to elicit the same N170 magnitude as full-band images. Our results with face stimuli are in accordance with previous work examining single-cell and MEG responses. Our results with objects are compatible with&#160;previous behavioural work showing a relative robustness of object recognition to SF manipulations. Our findings are novel in showing that the middle band elicits the same N170 as full-band images in both faces and objects.

'Studies of the angular function of a Duncker-type induced motion illusion',
'Duncker (1929/1955, <i>Source Book of Gestalt Psychology</i>, pp&#160;161&#8211;172) demonstrated a laboratory version of induced motion. He showed that, when a stationary spot of light in a dark laboratory is enclosed in an oscillating rectangular frame, the frame is perceived as stationary and the dot appears to move in the direction opposite the true motion of the frame. Zivotofsky (2004, <i>Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science</i> <i><b>45</b></i> 2867&#8211;2872) studied a more complex variant of the&#160; Duncker illusion, in which both the inducing and the test stimuli moved: a single red test dot moved horizontally left or right while a dense background set of black dots on a white background moved vertically up or down. When the background inducing dots moved up (down), the truly horizontally translating test dot appeared to drift at an angle down (up) from the horizontal. In experiment&#160;1, we used two methods to measure the complete angular function of the Zivotofsky effect and found it to peak with an inducer&#8211;test direction separation of approximately 30&#176;, similar to the inducing angle that has been found to maximise other direction illusions. Experiment 2 tested and confirmed predictions regarding the effects of relative test and inducer speeds based on the vectorial subtraction of the inducing velocity from the test velocity.

'<i>SHORT AND SWEET</i>
        A comparison of self-reported and measured autostereogram skills with clinical indicators of vergence and accommodative function',
'Failure to perceive the disparity-defined form in autostereograms by those with clinically normal stereoacuity can occur when achieving or maintaining the precise vergence angle required to place the intended left and right images on corresponding areas of the two retinas is difficult. Since vergence and accommodation must be maintained at different depth planes to permit sensory fusion of an autostereogram, poor autostereogram skill has been suggested by different investigators to be related either to the presence of a binocular vision anomaly (ie a poorly tuned binocular system) or to a binocular system that is well-coordinated. The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between binocular visual performance and autostereogram skill.

'Mapping the &#8220;forbidden zone&#8221; near and away from&#160;the&#160;fixation point',
'Burt and Julesz modified the classical view of Panum&#8217;s fusional area by incorporating the concept of the disparity gradient. They found that an area of double vision, described as the forbidden zone for single vision, is present when the angular separation between two objects is small. However, Krol and van de Grind argued that Burt and Julesz&#8217;s finding could be explained by the classical theories (specifically Ogle, 1932 <i>JOSA</i> <b>22</b> 664&#8211;728) in which the probability for fusion is a function of peripheral angle and disparity magnitude. We examined whether a forbidden zone can be specified within Ogle&#8217;s experimental space. We found forbidden zones (a) when fixation was placed on one of the two objects and (b) when fixation was placed away from both objects. Krol and van de Grind&#8217;s arguments do not easily explain the results in (b). The size of the forbidden zones was less than the predicted disparity gradient of unity that Burt and Julesz found in their experiment.

'The composite-face effect survives asymmetric face distortions',
'In two experiments, we investigated whether adults use holistic processing even for faces that are grossly distorted because their eyes have been moved asymmetrically to violate the common layout of a face (distorting its first-order relations). To this end we used a compelling demonstration that faces are processed as wholes, the composite-face effect. Specifically, adults judged the similarity of sequentially presented top halves of normal (original condition) and distorted faces with one eye (one-eye condition) or two eyes (two-eyes condition) shifted up by an abnormal amount. Trials were either blocked by type of distortion (experiment&#160;1) or intermixed within the experiment (experiment&#160;2). In both experiments, participants demonstrated a composite-face effect of the same magnitude in the three conditions, a pattern suggesting that they processed holistically even faces whose first-order relations were violated.

'Consistency of likeability of objects across views and time',
'Subjective impressions of face images (eg personality trait judgments) are consistent across exposure durations and viewpoints. In this study, we investigated whether subjective likeability of common non-face objects would also be consistent. Participants rated the likeability of 32 common objects (eg chair, car, and kettle). Although the rated likeability scores were generally higher for objects shown in three-quarter views than for the same objects shown in full-frontal views, object-wise correlations across the views were significant (experiment 1). The likeability ratings based on brief exposure duration (eg 100 ms) also significantly correlated with those based on unlimited exposure duration (experiment 2). Even when the duration was brief, the consistency across the views was replicated. The findings confirmed that the subjective likeability of common objects is consistent and the process underlying it is efficient, similar to those of faces. However, the mean rated likeability was higher for longer exposure durations, suggesting a negative bias for briefly observed objects. Since this bias is contrary to previously reported findings for faces, the mechanisms for determining subjective likeability of common objects may be partially different from those of faces.
