Start loading abstract articles:
The articles are either TALKS or POSTERS. The difference between a TALK and a POSTER is that a POSTER will display an upload box for the speaker to load a copy of the poster as a PDF for download. The XML structure for a POSTER is the same as a TALK

The articles are grouped in SETS. These can be used to identify Talk/Poster sessions by date and time.

In this example, we have a set called Our Talks, Monday Morning, 3rd September. Talks and poster are mixed together in this set
