'London&#8217;s legal elite: recruitment through cultural capital and the reproduction of social exclusivity in&#160;City professional service fields',
'The authors examine the ways in which recruitment and selection processes facilitate the reproduction of elites and elite cultures within City law firms. The research is based upon original research carried out during 2009, consisting of in-depth semistructured interviews, semiotic and content analyses of recruitment materials and websites, and the analysis of publicly available data demonstrating the educational backgrounds of lawyers practising in the City. By deploying Bourdieusian concepts including the field, &#8216;doxa&#8217;, cultural capital, and habitus, the authors show that, in the firms studied, homologous elite cultures and social groups are maintained and legitimated as part of attempts to reproduce &#8216;normalised&#8217; expectations about the identity and practice of a City professional. Maintenance is ensured by assessing the objectified, institutionalised, and embodied cultural capital of applicants in recruitment and selection processes, with only those possessing certain types of capital being recruited. This selection by cultural capital limits social mobility in City professions, which are dominated by the upper-middle classes, and helps explain why, in the face of critique and in the context of programmes designed to widen social diversity, the City legal profession remains socially exclusive.

'Gas price variations and urban sprawl: an empirical analysis of the twelve largest Canadian metropolitan areas',
'We conduct a multivariate analysis of the potential impact of higher gas prices on urban sprawl in the twelve largest Canadian Metropolitan Areas for the period 1986&#8211;2006. Controlling for variables such as income and population, we show that higher gasoline prices have significantly reduced urban sprawl. On average, a 1% increase in gas prices has caused a 0.32% increase in the population living in the inner city and a 0.60% decrease in low-density housing units. Our results also show that higher incomes have played a significant role in increasing urban sprawl.

'Governing economic futures through the war on inflation',
'This paper explores how efforts to understand, present, and act upon the futures of inflation participate in the governance of contemporary economic life. The point of departure is the claim that inflation is both an economic and an affective fact, subsisting as a potentially disruptive event within contemporary liberal democracies whose chief concern is to secure the conditions for the value-activating process of economic growth. Understanding efforts to secure these conditions requires attention to the anticipatory processes through which the futures of inflation are generatively disclosed in the present as matters of public concern. In attending to these processes, this paper focuses on how the problem of inflation, and efforts to fight it, are linked closely with the logics and rhetoric of warfare. First, it outlines how interest in these processes emerged, at least in part, through attempts during the Second World War to render the futures of inflation actionable via public information campaigns. Second, it highlights the role of presidential speeches and addresses in &#8216;the war on inflation&#8217; in the US during the 1970s and early 1980s. Third, and finally, the paper considers the importance of the promissory logics of inflation targeting in contemporary liberal democracies, in which inflation figures as a disruptive and generalised threat lurking in economic activity. In each case, efforts to fight inflation are based upon the premise that techniques of disclosure are a necessary element of generating the very futures they seek to make public. To govern inflation is therefore as much about governing orientations towards futures as it is about acting upon a well-defined epistemic object. In concluding, the paper speculates upon the wider implications of this claim for understanding how economic life is governed.

'On shaky ground: the making of risk in Bogot&#225;',
'How does risk become a technique for governing the future of cities and urban life? Using genealogical and ethnographic methods, this paper tracks the emergence of risk management in Bogot&#225;, Colombia, from its initial institutionalization to its ongoing implementation in governmental practice. Its specific focus is the invention of the &#8216;zone of high risk&#8217; in Bogot&#225; and the everyday work performed by the officials responsible for determining the likelihood of landslide in these areas. It addresses the ongoing formation of techniques of urban planning and governance and the active relationship between urban populations and environments and emerging forms of political authority and technical expertise. Ultimately, it reveals that techniques of risk management are made and remade as experts and nonexperts grapple with the imperative to bring heterogeneous assemblages of people and things into an unfolding technopolitical domain.

'Field expertise in rural land management',
'This paper explores the expertise of field-level advisors in rural land management. The context is the English uplands and negotiation over a Higher Level Stewardship agreement. An observed encounter between a hill farmer, his retained land agent, and an ecologist working for Natural England illustrates the multiple roles that field-level advisors have in regulating, directing, and influencing contemporary land management. The paper draws on field notes taken during work shadowing and in-depth interviews, to reflect upon the relationships that constitute field expertisenot only between farmer and advisor, but amongst the advisors too (and those who advise them). We argue that expert&#8211;expert interaction and the emergence of networks of practice are crucial to the development of field expertise and are key factors in the increasing complexity of the&#160;decision making underpinning contemporary land management.

'Human&#8211;landscape relations and the occupation of space: experiencing and expressing domestic gardens',
'thinking about human&#8211;landscape relations. Empirical findings are presented from a research project based on data from the Mass Observation Archive relevant to gardens and gardening. These data are analysed to explore how &#8216;ordinary&#8217; people (who have contributed to this Archive) express and experience issues concerning their home gardens. Our analysis suggests four distinct  relevant to the ways in which these lay writers describe their garden and gardening experiences and activities. The naturalistic mode is occupied with the garden as expressive of &#8216;nature&#8217;; the nostalgic mode is occupied with memory and self-reflection; the pragmatic mode concerns tasks/activities that constitute the routine practices of gardening; and the mimetic mode is occupied with the interpersonal dynamics and processes of human social activity. The analysis is situated in the theoretical context of some recent developments in nonrepresentational theory. We suggest that our approach and data are compatible with the process-orientation of nonrepresentational thinkers, and that&#8212;contrary to certain objectivist tendencies within nonrepresentational theorising&#8212;this approach does not need to neglect the importance of issues of subjectivity and experience, and the relevance of textual data. We aim to lend empirical substance to recent theoretical and philosophical discussions on space, and speculations about why the home garden appears to be so important to many people.

'A sense of momentum: mobility practices and
        dis/embodied landscapes of energy use',
'This research examines how the commute practices of driving, cycling, and walking shape individuals&#8217; sense of mobility energy use. Some scholars argue that different modes of mobility produce different ways of knowing the world. For instance, automobiles are accused by some of alienating their drivers, whereas others see the human-machine hybrids they create as inherently connecting. This paper is founded upon an epistemological position that sees knowledge as developed through sensual interactions with environments and held, sometimes inexpressibly, within the body. Transportation technologies, both as part of a person&#8217;s environment and as an extension of themselves, mediate these interactions. The research draws on in-depth interviews with drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians commuting in the City of Vancouver, and their commute narratives and GPS logs, to compare the sense of energy use between mode users. Participant senses explored include the feeling of momentum, changes in elevation, and stopping. Data analyses reveal active-mode users&#8217; nuanced and sometimes tacit awareness of energy use, and how this embodied knowledge both consciously and unconsciously informs their mobility. The efficiencies gained through this tacit knowing should be recognized alongside the more common &#8216;neotechnological&#8217; approaches to transportation energy conservation, and accounted for in planning, public policy, and law.

'Knowledge in the air and cooperation among firms: traditions of secrecy and the reluctant emergence of specialization in the ceramic manufacturing district of&#160;Lampang, Thailand',
'We study interfirm relations among ceramic tableware manufacturers in the city of Lampang, Thailand. Data consist of face-to-face interviews with the principals of thirty-four manufacturers, and with representatives of supporting institutions. We find that specialization in production and knowledge sharing are complementary; that knowledge sharing is substantially discretionary, rather than taking the form of passive spillovers; and that a weak knowledge base, built on firm-based training within vertically integrated mass producers, constrains the development of flexible specialization, despite the efforts of numerous local and external actors.

'Saving, spending, and future-making: time, discipline, and money in development',
'informed accounts of social practices around saving and collective remittances in poor countries this paper examines how the malleability of money enables it to have the potential for formalisation which allows it to be brought into formal relations of future-making and foreclosure, at the same time as its potential for investments and reallocation enables it to be the basis of flexible and adaptive strategies of future-making. We show how individuals engaged in development aspirations strive to achieve futures through the collection, care, and use of money, and how strategies of formalisation, discipline, and framing accord money developmental capacities. The liquidity of money renders it a flexible vehicle for personal and collective aspirations while representing risk of leakage to other persons and ventures. The paper examines the strategies used by low-income savers and hometown associations in their concerns with establishing rules and discipline around the flexibility of money.

'Futures in the making: practices to anticipate &#8216;ubiquitous computing&#8217;',
'This paper addresses the discourse for a proactive thinking of futurity, intimately concerned with technology, which comes to an influential fruition in the discussion and representation of &#8216;ubiquitous computing&#8217;. The imagination, proposal, or playing out of ubiquitous computing environments are bound up with particular ways of constructing futurity. This paper charts the techniques used in ubiquitous computing development to negotiate that futurity. In so doing, it engages with recent geographical debates around anticipation and futurity. The discussion accordingly proceeds in four parts. First, the spatial imagination engendered by the development of ubiquitous computing is explored. Second, particular techniques in ubiquitous computing research and development for anticipating future technology use, and their limits, are discussed through empirical findings. Third, anticipatory knowledge is explored as the basis for stable means of future orientation, which both generates and derives from the techniques for anticipating futures. Fourth, the importance of studying future orientation is situated in relation to the somewhat contradictory nature of anticipatory knowledges of ubicomp and related forms of spatial imagination.
