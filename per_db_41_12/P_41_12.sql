'Recognizing degraded faces: The contribution of configural and featural cues',
'Human face-recognition processes must maintain high levels of performance under different viewing conditions. An important dimension of variability is image resolution, which is affected by distance, refractive errors, and light levels. Here, we investigate how changes in resolution modulate the visual-system&#8217;s ability to detect featural versus configural changes in face images. It&#160;has been suggested that at lower spatial frequencies the visual system relies predominantly on configural information, yet, to our knowledge, no experiments have systematically examined this idea. We determined subjects&#8217; relative sensitivities to configural and featural changes for systematically degraded images. We show that overall configuration and local features are processed equally well at the different resolution levels, supporting the idea of a holistic face-representation that encompasses both feature shape information and information about the distance between the features. These data have also enabled us to derive lower bounds for the resolution needed to effectively use each type of information. Our data are replicated with a completely different face stimulus set, but are not replicated when subjects were shown houses instead of faces. Overall, these results suggest that at lower spatial frequencies, facial representations embody both configural and featural attributes equally, and provide a platform for investigating the essence of holistic facial representations for low-resolution images.

'Aesthetic issues in spatial composition: Representational fit and the role of semantic context',
'Previous research on aesthetic preference for spatial compositions has shown robust, systematic preferences for object locations within frames and for object perspectives. In the present experiment, we show that these preferences can be dramatically altered by changing the contextual meaning of an image through pairing it with different titles, as predicted by a theoretical account in terms of &#8220;representational fit&#8221;. People prefer standard (default) compositions with a neutral title that merely describes the content of the picture (eg side-view of a plane with the title &#8220;Flying&#8221;) but nonstandard compositions when they &#8220;fit&#8221; a title with compatible spatial implications (eg rear-view of a plane with the title &#8220;Departing&#8221;). The results are discussed in terms of their implications for theories based on representational fit versus perceptual and conceptual fluency and with their implications for classic aesthetic accounts in terms of preference for novelty through violating expectations.

'Effects of orientation and contrast upon targets in straight and curved arrays',
'A regular array of black squares against a gray background increases the threshold for&#160;a light disk in an intersection of the alleys separating the squares, an illusion variously called the extinction illusion, &#8220;blanking&#8221; phenomenon, or &#8220;vanishing disk&#8221;. Curving the alleys (making the squares into curved &#8220;tetragons&#8221;) further increases the thresholds for both light and dark disks. This raises three questions: (1)&#160;Do the edges of the tetragons interact with similarly oriented components of a target? (2)&#160;Is blanking a different phenomenon from the obscuring (more moderate increase in threshold in&#160;the presence of an array) that affects dark disks, or is blanking simply weaker for dark disks? (3)&#160;Is&#160;blanking a function of light versus dark targets or dependent upon contrast relative to the polarity of the inducing array? We replaced the target disks with parallel line segments to explore the influence&#160;of orientation of the line segments relative to the nearby orientation of the alleys. We show that the blanking phenomenon is sensitive to the orientation of the line segments, while the weaker obscuring&#160;of dark targets is not. We also examine these effects with white tetragons. Reversing the polarity of&#160;the tetragons exchanged which line segments were orientation-sensitive, although the effectiveness of&#160;white tetragons for blanking was weaker than that of black tetragons. We consider possible reasons why white tetragons may be less effective than black tetragons under our conditions.

'Mixed-ethnicity face shape and attractiveness in humans',
'Many studies show agreement within and between populations and cultures for general judgments of facial attractiveness. Studies that have examined the attractiveness of specific traits have also highlighted cross-cultural differences for factors such as symmetry, averageness, and masculinity. One trait that should be preferred across cultures is heterozygosity. Indeed, several studies suggest that mixed ethnicity, in terms of appearing to possess a mixture of traits from different human population groups, may be found attractive, which could reflect preferences for heterozygosity. We examined preferences for manipulated face shape associated with different populations in both Europeans (Britain) and Africans (Guinea-Bissau). We found that mixed-ethnicity face shapes were more attractive than enhanced single-ethnicity face shape across both populations. These results are consistent with evolutionary theories suggesting individuals should prefer heterozygosity in partners because facial cues to mixed-ethnicity are likely to indicate diverse genes compared to cues that indicate a face belongs to a single particular culture or population.

'Alligator or squirrel: Musically induced fear reveals threat in ambiguous figures',
'Extant evidence has shown that fear can influence what we see. Fear can exaggerate threatening visual features or make them more salient. Here we show that fear can alter the meaning of what is seen. Three newly devised ambiguous figures that can be seen as benign or dangerous objects were presented for brief intervals. The majority of participants reported perceiving benign objects in a neutral control condition and in a condition in which happiness was induced; but, when fear was induced, the majority reported seeing dangerous objects. This suggests that fear can alter the meaning attributed to a visually perceived stimulus. In this study happiness and fear were induced using instrumental music, so the findings also suggest that sound can influence vision by influencing emotions.

'Grouping by form in young infants: Only relevant&#160;variability promotes perceptual learning',
'Infants do not readily organize visual pattern information using form similarity: 3 to 4 month olds familiarized with arrays consisting of alternating columns or rows of a given element contrast do not display a subsequent preference for a novel organization of horizontal versus vertical bars. However, when array types composed of different element contrasts are presented during familiarization, infants perform successfully, indicating that variability in pattern information depicting an invariant structure promotes perceptual learning. In the current investigation, we examined whether the type of variability (relevant versus irrelevant) impacts this learning, as a way to understand the specificity and mechanism underlying the learning. In experiment&#160;1, one group of infants (relevant variability) was familiarized with three element contrasts forming column&#8211;row arrays on different trials, and a fourth element contrast that formed an outer enclosing context on all trials. For the other group (irrelevant&#160;variability), the column&#8211;row array was composed of the same element contrast across trials, while the&#160;outer context differed across trials by being composed of three different element contrasts. Only the relevant variability group performed successfully. Experiment&#160;2 showed that the failure of irrelevant variation to facilitate organization was not due to insensitivity to the variation among elements in the outer context. The findings suggest that variation which emphasizes global structure and deemphasizes local element information is a significant factor in facilitating perceptual learning.

'Does size matter?',
'For isolated objects in complete darkness, retinal image size contributes to distance judgments even if the true object size is unknown. Here we show that the same is true under more natural conditions. On a wide beach we positioned a red cube at 10&#8211;20&#160;m distance and then asked subjects to walk to it while blindfolded. Subjects never had a close view of the cube and were unaware that on separate trials cubes with sides of 15&#160;cm and 20&#160;cm were positioned at the same locations. On&#160;average, subjects walked 1&#160;m further after seeing the 15&#160;cm cube than after seeing the 20&#160;cm cube.

'Apparent height and body mass index influence perceived leadership ability in three-dimensional faces',
'Facial appearance has a well-documented effect on perceived leadership ability. Face judgments of leadership ability predict political election outcomes across the world, and similar judgments of business CEOs predict company profits. Body height is also associated with leadership ability, with taller people attaining positions of leadership more than their shorter counterparts in both politics and in the corporate world. Previous studies have found some face characteristics that are associated with leadership judgments, however there have been no studies with three-dimensional faces. We assessed which facial characteristics drive leadership judgments in three-dimensional faces. We found a perceptual relationship between height and leadership ability. We also found that facial maturity correlated with leadership judgments, and that faces of people with an unhealthily high body mass index received lower leadership ratings. We conclude that face attributes associated with body size and maturity alter leadership perception, and may influence real-world democratic leadership selection.

'Accommodation, pattern glare, and coloured overlays',
'We manipulated the accommodative response using positive and negative lenses to study any association between symptoms of pattern glare and accommodation. Two groups of eighteen young adults were selected from seventy-eight on the basis (i) that their rate of reading increased by 5% or more with an overlay compared to their rate without it, and (ii) that they reported more than 2 symptoms of pattern glare (group&#160;1) or had no such increment in reading speed and reported fewer than 3 symptoms (group&#160;2). Under double-masked conditions participants observed at 0.4&#160;m a pattern of stripes while measurements of accommodation were made using an open field autorefractor with and without positive and negative trial lenses (0.75&#160;D), and with and without a coloured overlay. Pattern glare was also assessed with and without the trial lenses. Without lenses, the mean accommodative response in group&#160;1 was 1.55&#160;D, a lag of 0.95&#160;D&#160;&#177;&#160;0.24&#160;D relative to the demand. The lag decreased by 0.43&#160;D ( p &#160;&lt;&#160; 0.0001) when the chosen overlay was used, an effect that was not shown in group&#160;2 even when lag increased with negative trial lenses ( p&#160;=&#160;0.13). In both groups, pattern glare scores were reduced by the trial lenses, but were unaffected by the sign of the lenses. This suggests that symptoms of pattern glare are not strongly associated with accommodative response.
