'Rescaling environmental governance: watersheds as boundary objects at the intersection of science, neoliberalism, and participation',
'This paper is concerned with the rescaling of environmental governance, and with the social construction of environmental and governance scales in particular. With the aid of case-study data from Canada, it is argued that watersheds, as particular forms of rescaled environmental governance, have increased in popularity because of their status as boundary objects: that is, a common concept interpreted differently by different groups. The paper shows how particular features of the watershed approach&#8212;namely, their physical size and the shared discursive framings they employ (&#8216;stakeholder&#8217; and &#8216;integration&#8217;)&#8212;make the watershed concept both cohesive enough to travel among different epistemic communities, and plastic enough to be interpreted and used differently within them. As such, it is suggested that the trend of the uptake of the so-called &#8216;watershed approach&#8217; reflects and is shaped by ideologies underpinned by three different, and occasionally competing, epistemic communities: the scientific, neoliberal, and grassroots communities. These arguments corroborate constructivist accounts of the political nature of boundary drawing, bring science into discussion on the relationship between neoliberalism and public participation, and contribute to environmental governance literatures by providing an alternative explanation for the uptake of watersheds in recent decades.

'Cultural diversity, institutions, and urban economic performance',
'Interactions between culturally diverse individuals can spur economic benefits by stimulating new ideas that raise urban residents&#8217; productivity. But diversity can also diminish economic well-being by making communication difficult, and by stimulating conflict. This paper investigates whether urban institutions&#8212;in particular residents&#8217; sense of generalized trust&#8212;determine when diversity is an economic asset and when it is a liability. To do so, data on trust, birthplace diversity, wages, and demographics in US metropolitan areas are combined. The evidence suggests that workers are much better able to harness the productivity-enhancing spillovers that arise from cultural diversity when they live in cities endowed with strong informal institutions.

'Special units for young people on the autistic spectrum in mainstream schools: sites of normalisation, abnormalisation, inclusion, and exclusion',
'This paper explores the experiences of young people on the autistic spectrum (AS) who attend a special unit within a mainstream secondary school in England. The paper feeds into contemporary debates about the nature of inclusive schooling and, more broadly, special education. Young people on the AS have been largely neglected within these debates. The paper focuses upon processes of normalisation and abnormalisation to which the young people on the AS are subject, and how these are interconnected with inclusion and exclusion within school spaces. At times, the unit is a container for the abnormally behaving. However, processes of normalisation pervade the unit, attempting to rectify the deviant mind&#8211;body&#8211;emotions of the young people on the AS to enable their inclusion within the mainstream school. Normalisation is conceptualised as a set of sociospatially specific and contextual practices; norms emerge as they are enacted,&#160;and via a practical sense of the abnormal. Norms are sometimes reworked by the young people&#160;on the AS, whose association with the unit renders them a visible minority group.&#160;Thus, despite some problems, special units can promote genuine &#8216;inclusive&#8217; education, in which&#160;norms circulating mainstream school spaces are transformed to accept mind&#8211;body&#8211;emotional differences.

'Lived difference: a narrative account of spatiotemporal processes of social differentiation',
'This paper draws on empirical research conducted as part of a study funded by the European Research Council to explore how individuals understand and live processes of social differentiation. Specifically, it draws on a case-study-life story narrative to examine how social identifications unfold across biographical time, examining the spatiotemporal complexity of experiences of differentiation, and the marginalization of self and/or others. In doing so, it contributes to the geographies of encounter literature by exploring the implications of insights from an individual&#8217;s narrative of lived experiences of difference for group politics and the management of prejudicial social relations.

'Recognising the time&#8211;space dimensions of care: caringscapes and carescapes',
'This paper is concerned with the geographical analysis of care relationships. It argues that concern with space needs to be augmented by a more explicit attention to the importance of time to caring. The paper discusses the importance of time to social relationships of care, and reviews existing attempts to integrate time with space in geographical research. The paper reflects on and extends the &#8216;caringscapes/carescapes&#8217; framework for research on informal care proposed in a recent book and earlier publications by myself and colleagues. It suggests that exploring the time&#8211;space links between the processes producing policies and services and those affecting individual behaviours is a promising avenue for future research.

'Experiencing space&#8211;time: the stretched lifeworlds of migrant workers in India',
'In the relatively rare instances when the spatialities of temporary migrant work, workers&#8217; journeys, and labour-market negotiations have been the subject of scholarly attention, there has been little work that integrates time into the analysis. Building on a case study of low-paid and insecure migrant manual workers in the context of rapid economic growth in India, we examine both material and subjective dimensions of these workers&#8217; spatiotemporal experiences. What does it mean to live life stretched out, multiply-attached to places across national space? What kinds of place attachments emerge for people temporarily sojourning in, rather than moving to, new places to reside and work? Our analysis of the spatiotemporalities of migrant workers&#8217; experiences in India suggests that, over time, this group of workers use their own agency to seek to avoid the experience of humiliation and indignity in employment relations. Like David Harvey, we argue that money needs to be integrated into such analysis, along with space and time. The paper sheds light on processes of exclusion, inequality and differentiation, unequal power geometries, and social topographies that contrast with neoliberalist narratives of &#8216;Indian shining&#8217;.

'Rhythms of the night: spatiotemporal inequalities in the nighttime economy',
'The authors seek to extend the literature on inequalities and exclusion in the nighttime economy through a rhythmic analysis of visitor presence in public space in nightlife districts in the city centres of the Dutch cities of Groningen, Utrecht, and Rotterdam. Substantial inequalities in visitor presence, based on race/ethnicity and gender, are demonstrated. In the cities considered, racial/ethnic inequalities vary more in spatial terms, and gender inequalities fluctuate more heavily over the course of the night. Overall, however, the findings support the argument that exclusion from the nighttime economy needs to be understood in temporal&#8211;ecological terms. Multiple drivers, or pacemakers, of rhythmic inequalities rooted in race/ethnicity and gender are identified, including opening hours and revellers&#8217; collective habits. For advocates of greater diversity among nighttime-economy participants, the analysis suggests that neither a more varied supply of nightlife premises, nor more surveillance and policing, are straightforward solutions: a strong orientation of premises toward university students and urban professionals may promote gender-based inclusion, but deters nonwhite revellers, and more police on the street may empower women to move through a nightlife district unaccompanied yet reduce the inclination to do so among racial/ethnic minorities

'Living together but apart: material geographies of everyday sustainability in extended family households',
'In the Industrialized West, ageing populations and cultural diversity&#8212;combined with rising property prices and extensive years spent in education&#8212;have been recognized as diverse factors driving increases in extended family living. At the same time, there is growing awareness that household size is inversely related to per capita resource consumption patterns, and that urgent problems of environmental sustainability are negotiated, on a day-to-day basis (and often unconsciously), at the household level. This paper explores the sustainability implications of everyday decisions to fashion, consume, and share resources around the home, through the lens of extended family households. Through interviews with extended family households in Australia, we explore the potential for these living arrangements to reduce resource use, and thus improve sustainability outcomes. In these households, a desire to care for and support family members in hard times (rather than an overt sustainability agenda) has promoted particular modes of extended family living, including unique forms of sharing and pooling material goods. But cultural values of privacy, space, and independence&#8212;and the sanctity of the nuclear family&#8212;have led to duplication (and even multiplication) of household spaces, appliances, and resources, under one roof. The potential environmental and economic benefits of resource sharing within larger households are thus mediated by deep cultural values and exigencies of everyday life.

'Auto-disabilities: the case of shared space environments',
'Many urban environments are being redesigned around a relatively new approach to street design termed shared space. Shared space is a traffic engineering concept that eliminates physical barriers separating motor vehicles, pedestrians, and other road users to&#160;encourage a sharing of street space. Such sharing is seen as a means to calm traffic and&#160;to create convivial urban spaces. The evidence shows that local authorities in the UK and overseas are enthusiastic about shared space for its potential to enhance the urban realm. Vulnerable street users, such as vision-impaired people, do not share this enthusiasm. They perceive shared space as likely to bring them into increasing contact with motor vehicles, and as compromising their safety and well-being. Shared spaces are, potentially, what I refer to as auto-disabling environments. Referring to data from the UK, I develop the proposition that shared space can be characterised as &#8216;disembodied urban design&#8217; that fails to capture the complexity of corporeal form and the manifold interactions of bodies-in-space. The disembodied understanding of the interactions between bodies, space, and movement, propagated by shared space design, (re)produces both existential insecurity and ontological uncertainty amongst certain categories of users, such as vision-impaired people. Shared space can be understood as a manifestation of disabling design in the built environment, and as a reaffirmation of disabled people&#8217;s relative invisibility in relation to the crafting of designed spaces.

'Small town vitality and viability: learning from experiences in the North East of England',
'Internationally, planning bodies and committees are required to make very difficult decisions with regard to the size, format, and location of rural retail developments, which may have significant long-term implications for the character and quality of rural life. Focusing on the issue of development location in the context of small towns, I&#160;evaluate the opportunities and threats associated with a movement to larger format stores. This is explored using case examples of town-centre development, out-of-centre development, and neglect from retail development within the North East of England. The results illustrate the potential to meet multiple policy objectives by encouraging town-centre/edge-of-centre development, but also permitting out-of-centre development when local circumstances render this appropriate.

'The effects of Seoul&#8217;s new-town development on suburbanization and mobility: a counterfactual approach',
'The author explores the effects of Seoul&#8217;s new-town development on suburbanization and mobility by evaluating a counterfactual situation involving variable urban spatial structures and citizen mobility in situations with and without the presence of new towns. Two different scenarios are tested: a scenario with new towns (baseline); and one with no new towns (no-new-town scenario). Both scenarios are tested by constructing two types of random-utility-based location-choice models which focus on employment and shopping locations. Findings reveal substantial suburbanization driven by the development of the new suburban towns, as well as both positive and negative consequences of new-town development. Seoul&#8217;s new town development has positively contributed to decreases in travel time due to the relief of congestion in the central city. This congestion relief results&#160;in major transportation cost savings of US$0.6 billion per year. The positive effects of new-town development, however, are offset by the negative consequences of suburbanization of the new towns. Negative consequences of suburbanization include longer times of travel for commuting and shopping trips, and increased emission levels.

'Educational mobility and the gendered geography of cultural capital: the case of international student flows between Central Asia and the UK<i>&#8224;</i>',
'International student mobility from East to West has grown rapidly as the middle classes have sought to reproduce their advantage in the context of changing socioeconomic circumstances. Existing research shows that middle-class students and their parents are increasingly using overseas educational qualifications&#8212;an institutionalised form of cultural capital&#8212;to ensure that they stand out in the competition for lucrative employment. This paper makes two unique contributions to these debates. Firstly, it broadens the spatial frame away from East Asia to the emerging educational markets in post-Soviet Central Asia, and specifically Kazakhstan. This shift allows examination of similarities in students&#8217; accrual of cultural capital between regions, but also highlights spatial specificity in these flows. Secondly, it moves beyond narrowly class-based approaches to spotlight the importance of gender, sexuality, and religion in geographies of cultural capital. Middle-class social reproduction helps drive international student mobility, but class is experienced differently by young men and women in the context of locally specific forms of heterosexuality which in this case study reflect the cultural importance of Islam. Class matters, but to fully understand its importance in student mobility we must trace its intersections with other axes of social difference.

'The effects of competition on the quality of primary schools in the Netherlands',
'We investigate the impact of competition between primary schools on the quality of education in the Netherlands. Do schools facing more competition in their neighbourhood perform better than schools facing less competition? As a measure of school quality, we look at the performance of pupils at the nationwide standard test (the so-called &#8216;Cito test&#8217;) in the final year of primary education. Since competition is likely to be endogenous to the quality of schools, we use the distance between the school and the city centre as an instrument for the level of competition faced by a school. Using a large range of data on pupil, school, and market characteristics, we find that school competition has a positive significant effect on pupil achievement, although the effect is very small. An increase in competition by one standard deviation (comparable to five additional schools in the market) increases pupil achievement as measured by the Cito test by 5% to 10% of the mean standard deviation, which is less than one point (on the Cito test scale from 500 to 550 points).
